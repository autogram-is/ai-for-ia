What is your current design review process for catching UI and experience bugs and fixes needed?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1ff5ppv/what_is_your_current_design_review_process_for/	I've been in this industry for almost 10 years now and have worked with so many over seas development teams, and in house dev team and have yet to find a great solution for this process.   \n  \nUsually it is reviewing the designs in a staging environment, taking screen shots, adding them into Figma, Google sheets, or jira tickets and then marking what needs to be changed and updated. I then share those documents with developers and other relevant stakeholders. This obviously lead to miscommunication and alot of back and forth, but even having worked at numerous companies I haven't been on a team that has this ironed out well.  \n  \nI'm curious what processes others are following during their design QA process? Are there any tools you're using to help.	4	4

How do I make data easy to understand for a B2C audience?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1ff3weu/how_do_i_make_data_easy_to_understand_for_a_b2c/	Hello fellow UXers! I'm looking for some expertise...\n\n\n\n**TLDR:** How do I make the graph significantly easier to understand?\n\n\n\n**Context:** I‚Äôm the only designer for a start-up that sells and installs solar panels to homeowners (and the product manager is away). We are a very data-driven company and have a 'calculator' that is able to give an accurate forecast of energy generation and savings you can make on your bills, based on a few questions we ask upfront.¬†\n\nThis ‚Äòcalculator‚Äô is essentially a dashboard with key figures and a graph (see screenshot below).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dff6ap3mydod1.png?width=2800&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e6d33fabe09f3fc5289be30047ef116cfe6ce84\n\n\n\n**Problem**: We know that our customers' main goal with getting solar is to save money on energy bills (environmental concerns are secondary). Customers are fairly split on data-literacy, those who understand graphs love the graph and the detail it communicates, ***many others just ignore the graph completely as they don‚Äôt get it***.\n\nI‚Äôm looking for a way to clearly deliver the value of our offering (i.e. how much money we could save you on bills) without the cognitive load of having to read a graph and make mental deductions. I‚Äôve tried making the graph simpler and clearer, but after testing it seems the issue remains that some people straight up just don‚Äôt get graphs and in a B2C setting aren‚Äôt going to try.\n\n\n\n**Question:** What ways can I effectively communicate the reduction in energy bills at a glance? Ideally not text heavy, a diagram, illustration or infographic could work.\n\nDoes anyone have experience in something similar? Making data accessible for a B2C audience?\n\n(Also open to any general feedback on this dashboard - it is not my design and I think could be improved)	1	2

Has UX process made you an overthinker when it comes to personal projects?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1feva3r/has_ux_process_made_you_an_overthinker_when_it/	So, prior to learning UX i used to watch figma tutorials and basic videos on design. Then i would design applications and stuff for fun. Some of them were outright bad and silly. But others were good too. And the most important thing is that i used to actually start things and try to finish them. \n\nBut after getting deeper into UX, especially after interning as UX researcher for 3 months where they no decision was allowed to be made without proper research and validation. From choosing what name should be for a feature to the flow of the feature and everything in between. Everything had to be in accordance to research insights by talking to users.\n\nThis had huge impact on me. After the internship i was finding it difficult to design any personal projects. I used to be like i don‚Äôt have access to the potential users of this application which would solve xyz problem etc. i couldn‚Äôt make decisions anymore. \n\nAt my current job, they aren‚Äôt research focused at all. It‚Äôs mostly making accessible and clean UX but it‚Äôs not based on research. Although we do look at what competitors do. But it‚Äôs all done in 1 day or so. Mostly based on assumptions. This is a very different from the approach i was exposed to. \n\nThe problem at my current company is that we are also a Dev agency. Sometimes clients of design and dev service. And the devs here mostly say nothing is feasible etc. So everytime i design something i am thinking if this would be feasible or not. And all my designs end up looking extremely basic which clients dislike. \n\nThe God level UI person at company never thinks about developers, using Colors from the Design system etc and ends up creating UI which clients absolutely love. \n\nI wish i could reach that level too. But i can never work without guidance (since i don‚Äôt know how to make decisions: from research point of view as well as design). \n\nAnyone had similar issues? Any advice on how i can stop this	1	7

Looking for design system recommendations	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1fdma8s/looking_for_design_system_recommendations/	I work with clients who often don't have a design system (e.g., early-stage startups), and would greatly benefit from one but have a limited budget for customization. I'm looking for a design system that I can standardize across multiple clients, customize enough that they don't all look similar, and that allows the customization to be done with minimal to no development effort (as in, a designer makes the customization and it can be directly exported). What I'm especially hoping for is a system that's extremely tokenized & semantic to a degree that allows significant visual changes purely through tokens.\n\nAny suggestions? I've found no shortage of semantic, token-based design systems that directly connect to code (e.g., Emulsify), but none yet where the tokens are extensive/versatile enough to significantly overhaul the visual appearance without fairly heavy development updates.	2	1

We have a very loose PRD for one project in particular, with no features or details fully fleshed out. It reads like we're throwing spaghetti at the wall.*\n\n&gt;*This person has changed acceptance criteria on the fly during meetings, and we now record those meetings so that developers and I have an artifact to reference. Changes happen in backchannels, and nothing is added to the PRD or even Jira; everything lives in people's heads or on Slack. I often stumble across changes that happened after seeing demos, while no one documented the change or told me about it...all the while asking, ""Why haven't the designs been updated?"" I follow up with this person almost daily with the PO, and rarely do they give me a synopsis. They know I will follow up with developers and assume I will hear from each of them about any changes that have been implemented.*\n\n&gt;*It's all around a difficult situation, but I cannot help but feel like the PO/PM should be documenting shifts to the strategy, changes in the acceptance criteria or feature set, and also respecting that they are breaking UX that had been decided upon weeks before - not to mention they are constantly breaking UI paradigms and making the platform inconsistent and inaccessible.*\n\n&gt;*Lastly, we're continuing to plan the next phase of work, moving at a rapid pace when we still need to catch up on a phase that was too big to begin with.*\n\n&gt;*Am I crazy? Are my expectations too high? How could we be tracking these changes and who should own that? How can I draw boundaries and hold them?*\n\n&gt;*Any advice or feedback is appreciated!

Do you know of any solutions which might be suitable?\n\nThanks!	9	1

It was a team put together by a very experienced tech lead turned business development person, and we were tasked to do something that an expensive consultancy had just have failed to deliver on after a years, so of course we had less time and budget to do the same thing.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the project was that there were two seasoned developers who had very little front end experience, and knew nothing about UX Design.

We were all problem solvers, and we applied our skills and knowledge to solve everything that came up in the project. \n\nWe delivered the proof-of-concept that the client asked for and some more, and the two developers were hired to complete the job while I finished up because all the key design problems were solved, and the developers understood enough about how I solved problems that they were able to tackle the rest on their own.\n\nIt turns out that sometimes UX gets in the way of UX Design.

It's happened slowly over time, but with no real head of product, head of design not bothering to go to design reviews etc. I think it's pretty obvious.\n\nDoom and gloom aside, as a UX writer looking to keep my job for a while before the company decides we can get away with a couple of designers for the whole company and that's about it, what can I do? As in, what kind of projects and initiatives should I be looking at?\n\nI found [this article](https://www.userjourneys.com/blog/ux-in-sales-led-organisations/) which gives some very basic ideas, but doesn't give any examples of how to go about doing any of it. For example ""Advocate for Long-Term Thinking"". That's easier said than done when the company is looking towards the sales team to close deals.\n\n90%+ of what we build are customer requests. But there's no validation. No thinking. No research or testing. We had one request from a well-known brand just yesterday. I pointed out that this seemingly small feature will make another part of our product look terrible/useless. The PM acknowleged this, agreed with me, and then just moved on. Because this new customer is paying for this new feature, right?\n\nThere's no, ""wait a minute, let's stop and think about how to build this for the customer but not ruin our exisiting features at the same time"".\n\nSo what can I do? I will try and build up relations with the sales team and solution architects to see if we can get a better feedback loop. But as a UX writer, there's little I'll be able to influence. I've once blocked a project that made no sense at all, but it's rare.\n\nAny articles, books, videos, advice welcome."	30	14

UXDesign	2024-09-09 19:48:12		davevr	Veteran	UX Strategy & Management	Career growth/working with other people	UX Managers:  what are your best practices for fully remote design teams?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1fcykte/ux_managers_what_are_your_best_practices_for/	"This one is for design managers or team leads.\n\nFor most of my career, I've run design in a design studio.  It was a physical place with designs printed out and stuck to foam core on the walls.  Every morning started with rounds, where designers showed their work.  Then we would do a 90 or 120 minute co-design session, where new problems were brought to the team to do the initial discovery or design work together, and a highly interactive session.  This was using the whiteboard, sticky notes, markers & paper, etc.  People did their individual work until late in the afternoon, when we would have another session, usually focused on critique.  In the in-between times, people would walk around the studio, check out the work on the boards, maybe leave notes or annotations, update their own boards with new work, etc.\n\nWhen Covid came, this fell apart.  Everyone went remote.  And post-Covid, the teams are too spread out to ever meet in person.  Many companies have downsized office space so they don't even have anything like a design studio even if people ARE in the office.\n\nIn my opinion, this has been very bad for design.  Actual design work is down.  Design impact is down.  Designer ROI seems low to the businesses.  More and more designer time is spent on production work.  The ""double diamond"" of design has become flattened - sometimes down to a straight line from what a PM says directly to a Figma file.\n\nI see the biggest impact in the two main skills of design - exploration and critique.  Exploration just isn't as good on your own as with a team.  You explore more avenues, consider more variables, and generally just get better solutions with more people contributing.  And critique has really suffered.  We still do critique, but now people work on something for days before sharing and only want to share things that are ""ready"".  By that time, it really feels bad for the designer to have people tell them everything that is wrong, and it requires a lot of redoing of work.  Also, critique requires a lot of trust in the team.  It is very difficult to establish that kind of trust, where I can tell you anything bad about your design and you will know that it is about the work and not you, when everyone is just a box in a video window.\n\nThat said - I don't see us going back to the office anytime soon.  \n\nSo what have you all done to help get better design out of your remote teams?"	31	13

There is so much to learn and there are so many requests coming in that I am finding it very difficult to focus on what to do. \n\nThe product is a mess with 15 navigation items and lots of inconsistencies, and I am being asked to think about new features while I haven't even grasped the entire system and how it works. There are no product managers and marketing is asking me to refresh the marketing website and the brand and give them illustrations for ads and social media!!

I have been at this company for 6 months and I've talked about it with my manager in two one-on-ones, most recently today.\n\nBased on the feedback, I've been able to narrow it down to one person on the brand team. I'm having a really hard time with the fact that I work with a lot of people and only one person is complaining about me and it's taking up space in my one-on-ones and making me feel insecure. \n\nMeanwhile, this person has never once attempted to talk to me one-on-one. They just go straight to my boss and say that I am combative and I'm not willing to problem solve etc etc. How can you say that when I've had less than 10 interactions with you in 6 months? If you've never once talked me one-on-one about any of your concerns? \n\nI kind of just need to vent. And lick my wounds. And then go back and try to have some one-on-ones with them. However, this feedback was supposed to be anonymous so I'm not even sure how to initiate a 1x1. \n\nAny advice? As a leader, I kind of feel like if my people work with a whole bunch of people and only one person they're having issues with, I might talk to them about it, but I would never think it was a big deal. That being said, my boss specifically said this was not a performance issue and they wanted to talk to me before it ever came that and blah blah blah and I might be too sensitive to the feedback. \n\nMy biggest read on the situation is that Brand is used to having control and is having difficult y giving up control. And this person just wants to get their way. In my experience, if you're having issues with somebody, you go talk to them before escalating to their boss. If you're escalating to their boss, you're just trying to get them in trouble. \n\nOne friend say well. Maybe they're just too scared to talk to you. I'm like, but they're not too scared to talk to me but they're willing to talk to my boss and get me in trouble? That does not net out in my mental math. You're either shy and you're going to keep it in or you want to say something then come and say it to my face. I'm really big on in a court of law you get to face your accuser and not a fan of anonymous feedback.	18	8

Just wondering if anyone else can relate to these thoughts after being in this sub for a while \n\nJob market\n- apparently terrible\n- I would argue that people with real experience who do more strategic work with product are still going to find a place in orgs, even if it‚Äôs not as easy as before. I feel people look for more depth of thinking now. Candidates who don‚Äôt showcase this well are suffering. Even if they DO have the skill, if it‚Äôs not being displayed‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs where I think it‚Äôs a big struggle\n- curious to know what others think of this \n\n‚ÄúUX is not for me/I hate my job‚Äù\n- seeing a lot of this sentiment. UX in 2024 is more about creating alignment? Yes this maybe means presenting lots of vision work to stakeholders to have little design expertise but still offer design critique. I think this has to be considered part of the job. Same goes for brainstorming with Eng, coming up with short term solutions that prioritize the business and not the user, etc etc. I know it hurts üòÖ but if you consider it part of the job it helps. Esp if the production cycles are long.  \n\nRisks/changes (and also opportunity!)\n\nAI\n- risk: lots of tech rushing to implement with minimal thought and minimal precedent on best practices \n- opportunity: steering direction and goals in a nacent field if you‚Äôre working on this. Or, if you freelance, this is a new way to market yourself - by showing how you design AI integrated features\n\n-risk: people using AI to generate designs \n- opportunity: specialize in things a generalized AI w ouldn‚Äôt be able to solve \n\nJob seeking:\n- I made a post on doing this a while ago, I wonder how it‚Äôs going now? \n- happy to see so many people pushing back on outrageous requests. We make the market.\n\nLong term career opportunity \n- still a concern for me. 5 YOE. Leadership opportunities seem narrow. Pivoting to product management or growing another skill set is something on my mind that makes me think there‚Äôs more long term potential.\n\nAny others relate?	11	27

I recently learned about open-source design systems like Flowbite and Material Design. I used to think that these were only available for dev teams, but it turns out they come with Figma files as well, including variants, tokens, styles, and everything you need. However, I still have several questions about the practical use of these systems.\n\n* What do you think are the pros and cons of using these open-source systems compared to creating a design system from scratch?\n* What is the main purpose, or in what cases, should we choose to use an open-source design system instead of building one ourselves?\n* Open-source systems come almost ready to use, but the default settings are from the system itself. If our client has specific needs, like using a different font or adding their brand‚Äôs colors to the style, what we have to do, is to overwrite these fonts and styles, and update the library right?\n* Related to the above, some systems like Flowbite provide a lot of font styles or color styles, but we probably won‚Äôt use them all. How should we manage the parts we won‚Äôt use? For example, I might only need H1, H2, H3, and Body for the client‚Äôs product, but Flowbite offers up to H5. How should I manage these styles in Figma? Should I leave them as they are and specify in the style guide what we are using?\n* As I understand it, the design system they provide is the ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù set of all UI component possibilities, and we don‚Äôt need to use everything. We just select what we need. These selected components will be documented in the style guide, right? And each piece we include in the style guide will still be linked to the main design system file (like the style guide is a filtered version of the design system that shows what and how things are used).\n\nThanks everyone for the input! :)	3	5

This would have been pretty easy in Flash, but I wanted to try prototyping it in Figma using my [about me site](https://abl.design) as a reference.\n\nGetting the components and animations to scale appropriately was a definitely challenge.\n\n[Marquee interaction](https://preview.redd.it/yw9a6igrmfod1.png?width=1265&format=png&auto=webp&s=27cccbff780204bd5822667d91b716d349283172)\n\nOne of the most difficult interactions was getting the marquee to keep animating on hover, which should show a text masked animated gradient when doing so. In the first few attempts the mask kept breaking or the timing of the animation would be off. I finally found that I needed to have the two animation components, one of the black marquee and one of the animated gradient, in the same frame and do a component swap on hover and another with a mouse leave interaction to reset the color.\n\n[Wires and interactions](https://preview.redd.it/13kz1g71lfod1.png?width=3842&format=png&auto=webp&s=5edc8d78d72830840db5fe62a988ce07d7c46182)\n\nI also wanted to allow keyboard navigation so there was a lot of turning off component interactions as components scaled or were in different parts of the site to remove unexpected interactions.\n\n[Variables](https://preview.redd.it/3wnquvf5ofod1.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=707c72c9da37a3d7dcd4567955c451fd54a47684)\n\nFinally, variables made it easy to create a dark mode and even make my navigation text smart when changing modes.\n\nThere‚Äôs some Figma animation and prototype glitches because of all the scaling it has to do, but once it loads into cache, the animations are a lot smoother, although this gives me pause considering complex animations in Figma Slides. Unfortunately the Figma prototype (or at least this one) causes Figma to crash and reload on mobile, so desktop only.\n\nThe experiment: [abl.design/exp/](http://abl.design/exp/)\n\nI'm pretty happy with how it came out. What you think using Figma to create a scaling site like this or using zoom for navigation. Good UX? Bad UX?  \n  \nThanks for reading.	6	2

It was a great company and one where I believe I could have been a strong fit, but this was a learning moment for me. Preparation is key, and I fumbled, oh well it happens. Lesson learned.\n\nNow, for the second interview, I came prepared. I reviewed, practiced answering questions, and felt confident going in. I got along well with the team, I thought I nailed the behavior interview with PMs and the case study with designers. Overall, I was proud of how I performed. But despite all that, I still got rejected.\n\nGUESS WHAT, I‚Äôm not down about it. If anything, I‚Äôm even more excited about continuing to pursue what I love and improving on what I have done. It's kinda like a user interview... But not. Here‚Äôs what I took away from these experiences:\n\n1.	Just be yourself: Don‚Äôt try to be someone you‚Äôre not in interviews. Authenticity is important, and the right company will appreciate that.\n\n2.	Rejections are part of the process: It‚Äôs okay if things don‚Äôt work out; there are always more opportunities. I know I‚Äôll find the right fit, and I‚Äôm keeping my head up.\n\n3.	Always be prepared: Make sure to do your homework. Use methods like the STAR technique and always refine your case studies. Continually improving will help you stand out.\n\nI know that the right opportunity is out there for me, and I‚Äôm determined to find it.\n\nHow do you guys handle interview rejections? Would love to hear any tips or similar stories!"	10	25

I‚Äôve got **5+ years of total design experience**. For **4 years, I was in communication & motion design**, and I even led teams in a well-known company.

I recently got laid off and have been struggling to get shortlisted for product design roles because I only have **1 year of ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù experience**. The thing is, I‚Äôve worked with people who have 2-4 years of product design experience, and I know my skill level is higher than theirs.\n\nI‚Äôve seen a lot of people who switched from graphic design to product design after 3-4 years, and all they do is change their last designation to ‚ÄúUI/UX Designer or Product Designer‚Äù on their resume to land jobs.

I've had several interviews processes all ended at various stages. I take the feedback and improve on top of that. I feel I'm getting better at interviewing.\nI've accepted a few tasks during this time for these main reasons:\n- I felt I was rusty with the tools after managing for so long and I want to go back to an IC role.\n- my portfolio needed more variety, I have worked for a single company for the past 9 years.\n- I was selective for job applications based on the overall compensation and I didn't want to be too picky for the hiring process too.\n\nI walked away only once before, they basically told me to critique and suggest improvements for their app, then to take a Netsuite screenshot and do it with their own UI.\nAnother task I did for another company resulted in an overall overwhelmingly positive feedback but no offer because they had the feeling I wasn't in love with what they're building. In this task I offered solutions to improve their layout and UX for the comparison of various products. I checked their website the other day and now they implemented a few of my suggestions. Which I'm sure many other candidates had thought about it so I'm not particularly pissed off by that.\n\nYesterday I withdrew the second time not accepting to do their assignment. I never met anyone from this company, they only send videos recorded on loom.I had to do a video presentation of 5 minutes about me and an app screen similar to theirs. I sent it on Sunday morning and in the afternoon the guy ( founder ) sent me to the second stage where I had to basically solve their onboarding flow.\nBut don't spend too much time on it eh.\nI asked for alternatives, I don't mind whiteboard challenges. I did a collaborative one and a blue sky one and I feel it's a good way to show how you can work under pressure. Even tho it feels a bit like your driving licence exam, in the sense that there are a few ""right"" things to do and ask even if it's not necessarily how you would realistically proceed in the real world.\nI asked if there was a compensation or covering for costs ( ux research and user testing was a soft requirement)\nI asked if the guy wanted to meet me on a call upfront to get to know each other.\nHe was adamant that they won't change their process.\nThey are clearly more interested in your work and not you as a person.\n \nHaving said that I knew that something like this could have happened. There's always the positive scenario where they ask to work on their product because they cannot judge anything unrelated to what they know. This means you portfolio case studies are basically ignored and they will have a strong bias towards your task result.\nIt is worse if they deliberately post job ads without any real intention to hire someone but leveraging on several designers free work. Mash up everything they like and instruct developers directly. \n\nNow that my portfolio has a few more projects and more variety, but I also understood how difficult it is to pursue a career in UX in 2024, I have set some boundaries for myself.\n\n- I will not accept a free take-home task that is related and relevant for the company business.\n- if they want to see how I work on their product and they're invested in hiring me they can pay for the day of work.\n- I am ok with whiteboard challenges. They should be between 45- 60 minutes long.\n\nI would like to get your opinion about this and ask you if there is already some sort of manifesto to adhere. That could help us to prevent companies to exploit designers to obtain free labour. It's a difficult (desperate?) time for the industry but this only really works if we are all aligned and define what is not acceptable."	69	126

I'm hoping to get input on what considerations I should have when deciding between the two.\n\n**A bit about me:**  \nI have 5 years of experience. I'm worked in the internal tooling space for a while with some experience in B2B SaaS. None of companies I've worked at are recognizable brands. In my recent job search, I've had some trouble getting interviews at companies with SaaS and consumer products because I don't have much experience with those types of  products. \n\n* Remote work, but it's not a must\n* I don't mind faced-paced agency work\n* Variety in what I work on is nice, but not a must\n\n**My career goals**\n\n* I don't love internal tooling and would love to have options to work on other types of products.\n* I'd love to step into a management role sometime in the future.\n\n**Offer 1:**\n\nHybrid- 3 Days in office at a brand name multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation. I'll be doing working on internal tools that'll help with pricing, sales, and promotions. This is a lot of what I've already been doing in the past. This offer will likely give me better career progression because it's a household name and has a structured career ladder\n\n**Offer 2:**\n\nFully remote at a full-service design agency. Not totally sure what I'd be working on. This offer will give me a larger variety of products to work on which hopefully will give me more options in the future. I'm unsure what the career ladder looks like here, but I did some sleuthing on LinkedIn. Junior and mid-level PDs are regularly promoted to Sr. PDs. Director-level designers have mostly been promoted from Sr. PDs\n\nPay is similar, but **Offer 1** is giving me a sign on bonus that's 10% of my salary. \n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Do household names at non-tech companies make a big difference for my career? I'm worried I may miss my opportunity to work at a brand name company.\n* Does sticking with enterprise and internal tooling cement me in this space forever?\n* Are agencies not a good choice when I care about moving into management?\n\nI am leaning towards one versus the other, but I'd love to hear thoughts from those more experienced than I am.\n\n	17	10

Since networking is bascially reciprocal but when I did networking as a new grad, I couldn't bring any value but just asking someone to give me a favor. \n\nI still see many are doing referral soliciting under the name of networking and it makes me think maybe I should have done that instead of just applying jobs.\n\nI'm not saying networking will never help you land on a job but do yall think it's more efficient way than just applying jobs from job board? Ideally you can do both but networking requires way more time and efforts so you can't really do both, if you network-focused, you might not be able to apply many.\n\nWhat do yall think?	38	35

Here are some (in no particular order) \n\n1. Not disclosing the salary range in the recruiter call. Here are some variants I have heard: \n\n* 'Salary is competitive!\n* We will know the salary once we level you\n* salaries are confidential'\n* Here, go check out the salaries - \*points me to glassdoor\*. Really? \n\nWhy would I spend 10 hours of interviewing time including prep, dusting off my presentation, preparing for behavioural interviews if you can't offer me the basic courtesy of telling me where (and if) we align on salary? \n\n2. Negging - This one was the worst. I came out feeling absolute shit after the interview and doubling in anxiety about my skills. The hiring manager was condescending throughout the interview and diminishing the value of my experience and skills as a move to justify the very low salary that was being offered. I was lectured about how the company would offer me a boost since they were well known (I already have worked in a fortune 100 so I'm atleast somewhat vetted and I went to a top 10 school for HCI). Why reach out to me if you think my skills don't make the cut? \n\n3. Employment clauses that might put you in debt if you end up owing the company money: I reviewed an employment agreement where the company claimed they could throw me out as they wanted, and claim back the sign on bonus. This is non standard, and sign on bonuses are usually clawed back if the employee leaves voluntarily. \n\n4. Hybridization of responsibilities: UX and UI can somewhat go together, if you have a design system in place. But to me, user research requires a different skillset - I've seen roles requiring quant, qual and ask for designers to run both generative research as well as evaluative studies AND be proficient in the works of data (all different skills). \n\n5. Leads doing both management and IC work: How does this even work out? Do you lead and set processes or do you manage a team? I was approached for one such role but I didn't have lead level experience anyway so I passed. But I see more roles created this way. \n\n6. Recruiters wanting work to be styled according to the latest UI standards - like, how. Just tell me how you would do this if you worked on an internal tool. \n\n\n\n	25	32

Started my career in 2013, and have been fortunate enough to work with notable clients. My portfolio has 4 case studies and I offer more private case studies in interviews. Up until last year it felt like 2 stages were the norm, with in depth conversational interviews being sufficient. \nPresent day, and I have had three company ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù in a row. The first company was really positive, gave great feedback and then asked me to facilitate a workshop with them to work on solutions for their upcoming feature. I spent 90 mins with them and ran through about 3 exercises in record time (not entirely realistic but still‚Ä¶) they loved it and came out with some really great ideas. I got a rejection email a day later. Their recruitment agent eventually dropped them because they had been repeating that for 2 months without getting close to a hire. I still don‚Äôt see the position filled and this was 3 months ago.\nAt the second company, a large frequent flyer miles company that want to move into business ventures, I passed the phone interview and a portfolio and process interview. I then received a design task which required me to: pick one of their current industries they want to move into, create a concept for a product, create branding guidelines, a business name, MVP design screens and 6-8 week strategy guide for a small team. Then create a 30 minute presentation with a 15 minute Q&A. I still had not met the actual team I would be working with. They said I should expect to spend 7-8 hours on it, but more if ‚ÄúI really want to set myself apart from other candidates‚Äù. I asked for alternative ways to assess my experience and suitability for the role including stellar references, but they refused. I pulled out of the race, feeling utterly defeated.\n\nMy most recent company opportunity, an AI fitness mirror company based in London, and I have not met them yet. They asked for a 5 minute video where I intro myself and to pick one screen I have designed. The requirements were ‚Äúto explain why I used specific colours, why I placed buttons where I placed them, why I chose the padding I went for‚Äù They didn‚Äôt want to hear about design process, any user research or user journey work, or metrics or outcomes‚Ä¶ because this was a role for a designer. I must stress, this is a Senior Product Design role, and not strictly a visual design role. I felt a bit silly doing it, but I gave it my all because I had lots of time to do it. They passed me instantly and gave the next task on a Saturday night. They have lots of technical issues with their mirrors which people all over the UK are angry about. The camera basically doesn‚Äôt really pick up whatever the person is doing, which makes the fitness aspect redundant. They are recording people without their permission and want me to come up with ideas to get people to record themselves without having to ask for permission for it. An extremely bizarre and unethical approach‚Ä¶ but also, they might want to look into engineering better? Either way‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre asking for all the notes I‚Äôll be making, user research, designed screens and advice on what they should do. I have to create another video to send them my work so they don‚Äôt even need to waste time meeting candidates. (I have since checked into their financial health and they are actually operating at a loss, have just 4 members of staff and had to put their company at risk to borrow more money- so this may be a wonderful way to get unlimited free work)\n\nI‚Äôm sorry this post has gotten long, but I fell in love with this industry and my career was on an upward trajectory - now I feel lost, upset, negative‚Ä¶ I worry that this trend will not stop. I‚Äôm not judging those that do the tasks, because times are tough and a designer might feel like the hoop jumping will pay off eventually but am I alone in feeling like these companies should all be called out for concept-farming? We are being seen as monkeys with miniature symbols. \nRant. Over.	58	153

And I suddenly got offered a job in health care which is what I was doing previously.... it's a great opportunity to work for a big company but it's only 4 months long.\n\nI didn't hate the industry I was working in but it never felt right. But just the first week of the design course has been amazing. I feel like I've found my calling. This is something I can see myself doing and enjoying. \n\nBut with the job market being the way it is and being offered this job that could lead to something more permanent I don't know what to do. I want to take this job, because either way it's good for networking and connections. (It's a large international company that would for sure need ux designers it's not just Healthcare focused.)\n\nHonestly I'm just having a hard time letting go of ux design, it feels like I'm giving up on a dream.... the idea of not taking this opportunity now and then not being able to find a job after graduating from the design program scares me more than anything ... please give so advice... do you think it'll be ok for me to try again later in my career? üòî\n\n I was really looking forward to working as a ux designer/researcher, but non of what I'm reading about the job market is at all reassuring....\n\nEdit: this is a post grad program. \n\nAlso I'm just looking for some honest opinion so I can get some perspective to help with the decision	16	0

UXDesign	2024-09-04 20:35:12		twotokers	Experienced	UI Design	Job search & hiring	Some thoughts on getting into UX and my experience while vetting applicants	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1f93wrk/some_thoughts_on_getting_into_ux_and_my/	"\*WALL OF TEXT INCOMING\*\n\nHello,\n\nWe all see the myriad of posts about getting hired in UX as a beginner and I thought I would share some insights from my experience breaking into the field and now attempting to hire talent.\n\nI began my UX journey in 2017, I did not attend any bootcamps and wasn't aware of any existing at the time. I studied Computer Game Design but did not graduate. While trying to build out a portfolio with real projects, I found that taking simple web design projects was a really easy way to get experience working with clients. I watched some tutorials on Youtube on how to use common website builders like Wix, Squarespace, and Shopify and got on Upwork and started lowballing offers. It was much easier to land contracts where I was able to design the website to their specifications but also build it for them using one of the tools I previously mentioned. Although web design is not the most highly regarded type of UI design, it was enough to get some real experience on my portfolio and also gave me the ability to design and create my own website. Once I had some completed contracts on Upwork, I started applying to more that were actually software design projects and was able to land a couple that really boosted my portfolio.\n\nFrom this point, I continued doing that while working a retail job until about 2020 when I first started to really look at taking my side hustle full-time. It was at this time that I started to see all the bootcamps pop up everywhere and rather than sign up for one, I actively chose to just apply to jobs without any real provable education on my resume. I'm not sure how this affected me chances but overall it took until January 2021 to land my first full time job. Since then, it has been pretty easy to maintain my portfolio and I have been promoted (Junior UX Designer -&gt; UX Designer -&gt; Senior UX Designer) and switched jobs twice since then, starting my newest position as a Senior Product Designer back in July.\n\nNow that I'm in the position to be hiring people to my team, I've noticed a lot of similar issues amongst applicants.\n\n1. Portfolios lacking projects other than bootcamp assignments - This one is huge because since so many people attend the same bootcamps, you end up with many applicants essentially with the exact same projects on their portfolios. The amount of GoodReads redesigns I've seen is alarming. If you want my opinion, even adding projects that you came up with on your own is going to make you stand out. Redesign existing apps and explain why you made the changes the did. Tackle individual problems/features in case studies instead of entire application redesigns. Seeing comprehensive ability to take a simple feature (creating a instagram post), tear it apart to it's basic flows, and improving on them will tell me a lot more about your ability to problem solve than just making something look different.\n2. Unprofessional portfolios - If you are not good at creating websites, there is nothing wrong with using templates for your portfolio. Too often I am seeing slow loading websites with improper CSS and HTML and altogether feeling very lazy. Unless you're doing purely visual design, your website doesn't have to be fancy but it does need to have a good information hierarchy and be easy to navigate. If I'm struggling to find what I'm looking for on your website, it does not evoke confidence in your ability to create a good user experience. Your website is also a portfolio piece in a lot of situations and it's often times the only one we actually get to interact with.\n3. Applying for jobs you are unqualified for - Do not apply to senior roles with no experience, do not apply to specific roles (things labelled ""Growth"" or ""Revenue"") without relevant experience. I had posted a job for a junior designer and another for a senior, the amount of applicants that applied to both jobs (having too much experience or too little) was pretty telling about the state of things. I would also like to point out that LinkedIn is deceptive. My job posting was showing 187 applied, but we actually only received about 60 applications before closing the post. Do not let the number shown on LinkedIn discourage you from applying.\n4. Not being able to answer common questions during interview - This one is probably the most damning to me. I go out of my way to interview folks that don't have actual experience because I think everyone deserves a chance. Often times, these people are not prepared at all for the interview and I get a lot of ""Ummms"" and ""I'm not sure"" when I ask questions about why they made a design choice they did. One question that slips up just about all the juniors is ""What ideas did you try that didn't make it to the final version? Why did you decide against it and what makes your chosen design better?"". Most of them can't answer this question which is red flag to me as you will rarely get the right answer the first time. So much of this job is about iteration and adapting to changes and if you cant tell me something that's been iterated on, I'm going to assume you always went with your first idea. I also can not stress this enough, but pick a project on your portfolio, outline common questions you think the recruiter will ask and prepare for you interview. You do not want to be caught off guard.\n5. It doesn't hurt to reach out after applying - You very well might be ignored but name recognition is very much a thing. Pretty much any designer that applies for the jobs, finds my LinkedIn and send me a nice message will at least have my attention enough to check out their resume and I will usually give them a screening call at the very least. It might not work for every company, but so much in the business world is nepotistic and just a friendly hello asking questions about the company can keep you at the top of people's minds in a sea of nameless resumes.\n\nThat's really all I've got. Hope it was somewhat informative. If you have any questions about anything I've said here, let me know."	16	85

With the hopes to help show business leaders the value of UX design. I think i have discovered something that at least could be useful in the context of mid sized companies looking to expand.\n\nMy hypothesis requires some background which i will share.\n\nThere is a theory called **The Diffusion of Innovation**, it basically says that people can be divided into groups for when they will adapt to new ideas. Most of you probably already heard about early adopters, this is one of the groups from this theory.\n\nThe early adopters or especially Innovators prioritize the **performance of the technology**, they would believe if the technology simply outshines in amount of functionality or how well the technology perform we will win over the competition.\n\nThe thing is, the majority of your potential customers would prioritize very differently, for them the **convenience of the solution** is far more important. They are harder to convince.\n\nMost often founders belong to the innovators and early adopters groups, they are in the forefront of technology, watching the latest breakthroughs trying to find an opportunity. Of course they will priorotize and focus on the technology primarily, which is fine.\n\nBut to reach wide market success you will have to make the solution convenient to attract the majority. And what better way to do so by utilizing UX professionals.\n\nThese days the majority understands that if the usability is bad its not their fault for not reading the manual, its the company. And will look for alternatives that meet their need. What happened was that in the early days the innovators and early adopters was the ones to design for because they drove the market. But these days the market is dominated by the more conservative majority that look for products that is easy to use and match their needs.\n\nSure early adopters still play a role to convince the majority but they are still the minority. So you want to start out by reaching the early adopters to eventually reach the majority. And to do that you will have to utilize UX professionals.\n\nThis hypothesis would also explain the gap between UX designers and business leaders, since the founders value the technology primarily and things like UI or usability secondarily, they would be harder to convince about the importance of improving things like usability.\n\nRemember the founders are themselves early adopters and innovators, they can live with a hard to navigate interface as long as the technology is better, but according to the diffusion of innovation theory i would say this is a lost opportunity to reach a wider market and companies like Apples i would argue proves that.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and experiences.\n\nEdit: Removed the statement, as Chris points out there are a lot more reasons out there to succeed in reaching the majority of customers.\n\n[ Image from the Donald Norman article \\""Growing Up: Moving From Technology- Centered to Human-Centered Products\\""](https://preview.redd.it/pniyl4izrymd1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=67866d81aae5bcf64e57632effa15623b9e85132)"	13	18

But all I'm getting out is the hype.\n\nOne major problem I noticed is that Sophia is a terrible teacher. She talks a lot and overhypes things and then tells very little. OR perhaps she's doing this on purpose to drive people towards the masterclass.\n\nSo here are my questions for those who went through the masterclass (if any), is the explanation/outcome better than what's freely available online? Is she the one teaching? Did you really get any benefit from it?	3	4

I believe the redundancy between that breadcrumb item and the page title is intuitive and can provide confirmation to users concerning where they are in the site. But maybe that can be TOO redundant?\n\nHere is what I currently have, with full crumbs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp4aykwmedod1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=55e0aeb697b83f700c3451800a977fc293b810db\n\nThe page title usually ends up *right below* the breadcrumb, though, so I'm considering going rogue and trying this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29wn356yedod1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b1bcf64b89a592ffbb4bb5efb91bd12901364b\n\nThoughts?

Suggestions on **best practices** for the UX revamp and any tips on how to prioritize tasks.\n2. Recommendations for **design resources** or references (websites, templates, tools) that are ideal for **mobile-first** and **conversion-focused** design.\n3.

Don't get me started on the engineer who was ADAMANT that we shouldn't have color in the dashboard at all because anything with color should have a visual glyph for color blindness... \n\nAnyways, looking for some insight here. How have you all navigated this? How can I change my thinking or approach? Thanks!"	16	11

I tried to get back into UX after this but had zero luck with hundreds of applications. I love design so a part of me feels heartbroken, I love tech and being creative but it almost feels hopeless getting a good job in the industry. My portfolio became more outdated as time went by and freelance work wasn't even happening. Maybe going to a bootcamp was my first mistake. Has anyone else had this experience?	238	261

They no longer have the option and it's such a frustration. You now have to select each message thread and mark it as read, can't even hit a select all button, and then select 'mark as read'. In my opinion having a 'mark all as read' is a necessary setting in any kind of mail/text receiving application nowadays with all the spam you get. What were the UXers thinking?	0	1

If Nasdaq crashes big time, the consequences will be seen in tech companies around the world as tightening demands for profitability, as well as tightening terms for getting financing for the company.\n\nUX is a luxury/ nice to have type of a part of production chain within the production of digital services and apps. So UX takes a hit everytime the economy tanks and the companies have to cut their spending.\n\nBut, if tech market would crash now or even in the coming half year, it would be exceptional as the tech job market is already horrible. Finding a UX job is already very difficult, and executives are already treating UX as necessary evil, so the budgets have already been cut down and the job is in many places nothing more than cutting corners.\n\nIf a big crash happens ( I sure hope it doesn't), how will UX industry look after that?	12	0

Whenever I bring it up, I'm told I'm not doing enough or that the company isn't in a position to offer more than a minimal hike. The stress is constant, and the expectations just keep growing.\n\nRecently, I had a tough conversation with my manager, where I ended up in tears because I‚Äôm feeling so stuck and undervalued. Despite the appreciation I get from peers and key stakeholders, it apparently doesn‚Äôt count for much. I‚Äôve been job hunting for the last 2-3 months, but nothing has come through yet‚Äîuntil now.\n\nI've received an offer from a smaller company (about 800 employees) in a senior Product Design role. There's potential for a 40-50% salary bump, and it's a step up in terms of position. But here's the thing: I'm not excited about it. The idea of moving from a big company to a much smaller one feels like a downgrade, even though it's the kind of role I want. I'm also worried that a smaller company might have its own issues with politics and toxicity, maybe even worse than what I'm dealing with now.\n\nAt the same time, staying where I am feels unbearable. I can't imagine watching another colleague get promoted while I'm still stuck with minimal recognition and a tiny raise. It's breaking my spirit.\n\nI'm really torn. Should I take the offer from the smaller company and risk the unknown, or should I stay where I am and keep looking for something better? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.\n\n(Update)\nThank you all for such detailed responses. Really helped me see through the fog!  They have rolled out an offer and offered me a whooping 60% hike from my current base üéâ	31	10

It originally started as a portfolio booster, but now I‚Äôm just helping them. The CEO is very young, and majorly micro manages. It feels like he just sits on figma all day staring at my designs picking out every little detail. \nThe newest one: the app is a meditation app. The audio players for meditation originally had the right side time on an audio bar stay stagnant (this is how YouTube, calm, and headspace have theirs) if the class is 10 minutes, the time on the right stays at 10 while the time on the left counts up from 0 as the class plays. \nRecently the ceo decided he wants the time on the left to countdown to show how much time is left. This is seen in music players such as Spotify, and meditation app 10% happier. I made the argument that this really isn‚Äôt necessary, the app is brand new and has a lot of bugs to fix that the developers should be focusing on instead, but he was adamant. And in this, wanted me to go through the figma file on all the audio player screens (there‚Äôs many) and change that left side time (where I had a mock in place of 15 min ) to show that it‚Äôs counting down (change them to 12:58 or something)\nThis similar situation happens OFTEN. \nMy question is: is this necessary in design? It‚Äôs wasting my time, I only give them about 10 hours of work a month, and seems so mundane and silly when this could easily be a note for developers. How literal do designs need to be?	13	9

And no tools provide freehand shape fill.\n\n  \nI highly doubt there would be anytools that could give similarly nice feeling like Invision though, if any please do let me know. \n\nOne good news is that Miro acquired Invision freehand and hoping they would run the same experience as Invision is currently doing.

UXDesign	2024-09-01 17:41:31	1	Moocows4		Answers from seniors only		"Does Apples ""Family Sharing"" violate principles of inclusive design?"	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1f6k9y3/does_apples_family_sharing_violate_principles_of/	"Apple's Family Sharing payment system, which requires all purchases to be made through the family organizer's payment method, raises significant concerns about inclusive design. This practice may inadvertently discriminate against or cause difficulties for various family structures and situations, including:\n\n1. Young adults with their own income\n2. People with disabilities managing separate finances\n3. Caretakers handling distinct financial arrangements\n4. Blended families preferring financial separation and multigenerational households.\n5. Those at risk of financial abuse, perhaps by spouse who forces being the family organizer and controls all members purchases.\n\nThe current implementation:\n\n1. Reinforces outdated stereotypes (e.g., ""man of the house"")\n2. Disregards evolving family dynamics and egalitarian partnerships\n3. Perpetuates financial inequality and potential for abuse\n4. Undermines financial literacy for family members\n5. Fails to recognize non-traditional family structures\n\nBy centralizing purchasing power, the system may unintentionally create a digital environment that mirrors and reinforces problematic financial power structures.\n\nProposed solution: Allow each family member to use their own payment method for purchases while still sharing content within the family group.\n\nI'm writing this post because I think Apples approach is wrong. When a member of a google family plan, such as Youtube Premium is added to the family, they have access to the premium Youtube features  such as Youtube Music but can still make purchases on the platform with their OWN google payment methods.  Apple under Steve Jobs implementation of sharing used to be called home-sharing and operate without the restriction of the purchases having to be made by ""organizer"". I also believe this hurt's anyone's whose content wouldn't be purchased because they wouldn't want it charged to Family Organizer's payment method.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Does Apple need to reconsider its approach to Family Sharing to be more inclusive?\n\nEdit:  [https://support.apple.com/en-us/108774](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108774) titled ""How to share apps and purchases with your family"" One adult in the family ‚Äî the family organizer ‚Äî pays for everyone's purchases after purchase sharing is set up. You can share apps, music, books, and more.\n\n\* If you're in a Family Sharing group, purchases that you make are charged to your personal Apple Account balance. If you don't have enough Apple Account balance to pay for the purchase, the remainder is charged to the family organizer if purchase sharing is turned on.\n\nThis work around allows for buying apple gift cards to add to your own account which is used before family sharing method, but having to load a gift-card is not easily accessible when ""add money to account"" button automatically charges family organizer's payment method.\n\nEdit/Addendum:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3m0q2bbwr8md1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dbdaa6c69e1fa4c7264a957ec4eaf56e50b0e27\n\n# What you can share\n\n* Music from the iTunes Store.\n* Movies and TV shows from the Store in the Apple TV app.\n* Books from the Book Store in Apple Books.\n* Apps that you can purchase or download from the App Store.\n* Subscriptions and in-app purchases from participating apps.\n* Subscriptions from Apple, including:\n   * Apple One Family and Premier plans\n   * Apple Music family subscription\n   * Apple Arcade\n   * Apple Fitness+\n   * Apple News+\n   * Apple Podcasts Subscriptions\n   * Apple TV+\n   * Apple TV channels\n   * iCloud+\n\n# What you can't share\n\n* Individual subscriptions to Apple Music, Apple One, and subscriptions and in-app purchases from non-participating apps.\n* Student subscriptions, such as a student subscription to Apple Music.\n* Consumable in-app purchases, such as coins or gems.\n* Items that are no longer available in the App Store, iTunes Store, Books Store, or Apple TV app.\n* Purchases that you or another member of your family group have hidden.\n* Content that was assigned through a child's school using Apple School Manager."	41	0

UXDesign	2024-09-01 06:07:26		imflowrr		UX Research		I‚Äôd designed UIs for 12 years but didn‚Äôt understand UX until an experience at a restaurant.	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1f67nm0/id_designed_uis_for_12_years_but_didnt_understand/	I started designing UIs in Photoshop and splicing them up into tables in Dreamweaver when I was 15. I kept designing websites and eventually web apps, but could never bring my designs to life until I taught myself to develop web applications and started my career 10 years later.\n\n2 years into my career I was involved very closely with UX consistently but really struggled to grasp what UX actually was as opposed to just UI design. I don‚Äôt remember exactly why it was hard to grasp, because now that I am familiar with it it all seems so easy. Regardless, yeah, conceptually, I struggled.\n\nI went to lunch with a UX guy one day and the whole time we complained about how the company forced the UX team to just implement crappy UI designs. Then the check came.\n\nThis was a restaurant called ‚ÄúPublic School.‚Äù It was all school themed, but classy as fuck.\n\nWhen the waiter came to the table and handed me a clipboard with a long strip of receipt paper clipped on, I instantly felt my pockets and looked around the table for a pen. I didn‚Äôt see one so I was like ‚Äúdo you have a pen I could use for this?‚Äù\n\nAnd he gently informed me that it was just the ticket‚Ä¶ that I don‚Äôt need to sign until after I paid.\n\nBoom. All the years of not grasping UX just ended right in that moment.\n\nI realized that I, the user, just ERR‚Äôd.\n\nI‚Äôd always heard of the UX book ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me think‚Äù but never read it. But in this moment, that book came to mind as my understanding all fell into place.\n\nI acted without thinking, based purely on my learned behaviors, and it was wrong. I had to think to realize what the situation actually was.\n\nAnd this experience has fueled my involvement in and around UX teams for the 7 years since that ERR.	18	69

But I'm also a very extensive player of video games (paging u/scottberkun), which is a phenomenal source of learning for design along with other non-web sources.   \n  \nSince we have lots of fear, gloom and doom, portfolios, repeat topics, etc, around here (many justified even if people are worn out), I thought I'd try a little light hearted but deep learning series around topics that aren't a website I'd like to call: \[Let's learn from\]. At least this time, I'm just going to recommend a video for you to watch and learn from, and explain why.  \n\n\nToday's topic: **Video games**. Specifically, a reimagining of a classic Nintendo run and gun action platformer:\n\n**Shadow of the Ninja Reborn**\n\nI think, if you have some time, you should watch this \~30 minute video analyzing and praising some of the designs of this game. Why? Well...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EonPKTXuej8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EonPKTXuej8)\n\n[Screenshot of Ninja Kaede slamming a grappling hook into a little spiked monkey monster as soldiers and robots surround her](https://preview.redd.it/ffp9t401vuld1.png?width=2034&format=png&auto=webp&s=b120b6582a997ff1ec6dfaf69a7520e8728da847)\n\n  \nSo, this analysis goes into a lot of the small design details with a ton of parallels to aspects of good interaction design, including:\n\n- Risk and reward mechanics, cost to decision making\n\n- Zoning and the importance of spatial relationships for interactions\n\n- Balance of interlocking game mechanics and interaction systems over overreliance on a single one\n\n- Values of using constraints to change and augment experience and playfulness (example: item system)\n\n- How animations and motion can support and provide visual translation for interactions\n\n  \nIf the design world is bringing you down, try a half an hour break to examine and learn from the joys of a game.\n\nHappy weekend y'all.\n\n\n\n\n\n	4	12

The leadership expects me to work ‚Äòstrategically‚Äô but the ground reality barely allows me to. There is a constant chain of requests for mockups for features and barely any time to understand the problem, do research or testing with the users. At best, I have to rely on the research the PMs do and create mocks, at worst I have to say no due to bandwidth constraints. \n\nThis has been seriously affecting my mental health and I‚Äôm constantly in fear of being marked as an underperformer. My motivation and confidence is dropping like a rock in a pond. What I‚Äôm not sure about is if I‚Äôm really struggling to perform or if the situation I‚Äôm put in is just untenable. \n\nI‚Äôm considering changing to a different team but even then, I‚Äôm worried that my drop in motivation and confidence would impact my performance wherever I go. \n\nWhat can I do to regain my motivation and confidence? Please share some advice. TIA! \n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nUpdate 1: Wow I‚Äôm so impressed by all the comments that you all have provided. This is the best community I‚Äôve been a part of.

I have tried to follow tutorials and guides online to make websites and user friendly experiences but at this current stage I am stuck on the basic part of wireframing. I don't know why such a easy task is so daunting to me but making boxes and simple components without being able to see their final design/look feels a bit off to me and I try to avoid this stage as much as possible and jump straight into design. I know this is not the right way but has anyone experienced here felt the same way when they started way back. How do you visualize the final good design and then try to build it with simple, bland shapes at the start of the process.	17	4

The company has a dev team, but no strong front end devs. Everything implemented by the dev team is like the bare minimum. We‚Äôve fought for months to get them to follow our design system so UI checks don‚Äôt last for weeks. I‚Äôm not complaining, jobs are scarce. But it is annoying to deal with and the nonstop back and forth with the dev team is exhausting. \nHere‚Äôs my current issue: Our product is not responsive which is super frustrating. I had experience helping to design the grid library for designers at my last job, so I volunteered to lead the initiative. However I had front end devs there to do their side of it. I‚Äôve done HOURS of research, incorporated Material Design guidelines, internal user data, AI, read parts of a book on going responsive, and used multiple legitimate online sources to determine the breakpoints and rules. The problem is I don‚Äôt feel confident in it because I‚Äôm not a developer. It‚Äôs making me super nervous that I‚Äôm almost to the point of handoff and the devs are STILL asking questions about how the breakpoints work and I don‚Äôt have the dev knowledge to break it down to them. What should I do? Tell my manager I‚Äôm not confident in my findings after hours of research, countless meetings with the greater design and dev teams, and curating this entire thing for months now? Our company cannot hire front end devs to figure this out, they honestly seem pretty lazy, and I feel in over my head although I am pretty confident in what I‚Äôve defined for them. Thank you. 	5	15

Think 'editing' or 'favoriting' a list item. We currently try to conform to WCAG 2.1 AA. Is there an accessible way to have interactive elements other than just checkboxes in a dropdown/flyout list?\n\nThey also made the claim that anything beyond select-only, multi-select, and comboboxes, is in violation of the above standards. When I asked why, they didn't seem to have a technical or concrete answer for this. If it's not obvious, this notion belies lots of notable applications that have complex menus of varying kinds, such as Air bnb's search bar flyouts, or Microsoft Team's search bar flyout, where multiple interactive elements are embedded in these components. \n\nI've scoured the internet for a11y or wcag or aria information on this giving them the benefit of the doubt, but I've found nothing that implies accessibility limitations on creating complex components. From what I understand, based on experience with previous ADA coaches, is that you can make just about anything accessible with proper labels, keyboard navigability, focus states, aria text, avoiding hidden hover-discoverable buttons, etc. I genuinely value web/app accessibility, but these coaches claims seem really obtuse. I know higher level hierarchy navigation is supposed to be consistent across the site/app, but what about things like dropdown menus? Can you have several dropdown menus that subtle differences such as sorts, filter chips, tabs, or nested navigation?	3	3

When they click to add a product, we have a dropdown list of products that when the user selects one of them there is a text field of the name of the product automatically filled and some subproducts associated with it and the number of each subproduct.

The subproducts can be more than one and he has to manually add each subproduct and the number of each subproduct.\n\nNow I am dividing on to how structure the UI of this as the section can have multiple products at once. \n\nWhat would be your approach on this? \n\n\nEdit: This is for a construction company and the user is the constructor.

Each has about 500 options in the list and allow multiple selection.\n\nOnly the last one is mandatory and it is the final options selection that has over 5K options in the list and of course also multi selection.\nSure, you can type in what you want to search in the input but I am not sure if using dropdowns with checkboxes for so many options was the best decision at all.\n\nAnd the users want to see all the options they chose and to delete/unselect them and it‚Äôs just too much information in one modal.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a problem like this? I‚Äôve been researching all week long but am honestly lost.	6	1

I loved print (still do) but after 18 years and 3 jobs designing I needed more. My role at my current place has evolved over my tenure, from a strictly print design role, into video, web platform management, email production, and now UX. I really enjoy UX design, it makes me feel like I did about print all those years ago. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm any good at it.¬†\n\nI hit 40 this year, and the ten year mark at my current company, and decided it was time to look elsewhere. I‚Äôve been engaged by a prospective new employer (first interview is done) for a UX designer role which pays almost double my current salary, and they‚Äôre keen to take advantage of my app experience - which is solely based on being part of a cross-functional cross-business working group in my current company. I‚Äôve been heavily involved in a majority of aspects over the last two years, from sign up and data management, branding, content updates, user flows, UI design, etc, all to great standards according to the dev agency PM (who has become a great friend over the process).\n\nNow, to the part that has me doubting all of it.¬†\n\nWe‚Äôre currently working with a new supplier to develop the second version of the app and I was sent a Figma file which their UX designer had put together. I‚Äôve always prided myself on knowing the programs and technical side of things - but this Figma file was something else. I‚Äôve made app prototypes in Figma with components and interaction before, and thought I knew my way around, but this had everything. She‚Äôd basically thrown the kitchen sink at it. Dynamic components, user flows, design elements that I wouldn‚Äôt even think to do in Figma. It left me feeling‚Ä¶intimidated? not ready? like I was making a mistake trying to go further?\n\nI‚Äôm keen to gather perspective from people in the know. Am I bordering on a mid-life crisis and overthinking, or am I really not as ready as I thought I was?	4	1

Over the 2.5 years I've held a full-time job, I've encountered this type of design feedback over and over: a senior (always senior) engineer strongly making lots and lots of nit-picky suggestions that don't have strong rationale. It's not just one senior engineer - there have been more than a few. It's like they are getting so invested in the design that they comment on anything they can think of. The problem is that they dig their feet in when I say ""I recommend we go with \[this other design decision\] because \[reason.\]"" I only try to turn them down this way when I think their suggestion is a worse decision - if neither their idea or mine is better then I'll make the change they're suggesting. I also often ask them to elaborate on the ""problem they're noticing"" to see if this is just a matter of miscommunication.\n\nHere's an example: I post a design for review, and they leave feedback. They prefer ""Primary"" over ""Default,"" they think the copy says ""Edit"" too much, and 3 or 4 other similar comments.  \n\nThis feedback usually comes during a review, but sometimes it comes after the design is approved and in staging. I think it's okay to turn down some feedback, but I'm afraid it hurts morale to turn down the majority of it without at least exploring it.\n\nNote, I work at a small startup that need to move extremely quickly. I don't have a more senior designer to go to.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar? How did you keep your team's morale high and continue to have a good working relationship, without making the product worse?\n\n"	46	40

It was pretty simple as a utility, but it was built up over the years.\n\nBack around 2017, I put the artboards in sort of a set of paths so I could do a flow that I understood. (A) This got more complex, and I did other flows in the same manner‚Äîbut it helped the UXR and the BA understand the flow.\n\nThe BA and I then mapped out the supporting APIs (B), and that helped me understand the APIs and tagged each screen where those APIs would attach to knowledge bases.\n\nLater on, I mapped out the general series of questions with themes like‚Äîdevice? physical issue or software? mac, pc? etc and did it more of a flowchart (C).\n\nI'd also worked with a repair tech who had an Excel doc that was really hard to  follow as a whole document, but if I were troubleshooting I was able to walk a path.\n\nHave you worked on any Chatbots where you have more of a tool to help you visualize flows for yourself or coworkers?

I started as a front-end developer and gravitated towards design and UX. Started with mainly websites and moved on to more complex web apps. \n\nI had finally found a decent career that I enjoyed and was great at. This brought me a strong feeling of relief, as I was a bit lost before this. I was promoted to Senior and then to Head of Design (it was a relatively small team). \n\nI always thought my previous titles (Senior UX Designer, Head of Design) would carry enough weight to secure me another role once I decided to move on from agency. I deluded myself into thinking this would be easy. \n\nLong story short, Ieft my previous job in March and I still haven‚Äôt been able to find a role since then. \n\nI‚Äôm not trying for fancy big tech roles. All I want is to earn like 130k AUD in a medium sized company in Australia. The effort required to do this feels completely disproportionate to secure what is really just a job in an office.\n\nAnyway, there‚Äôs my story. Just wanted to get it out there. I‚Äôm having a really rough time. Living with my parents. Stressed beyond belief. The self doubt and imposter syndrome is immense. Any pointers or advice would be welcome. \n\nEdit: I am well aware that titles at smaller agencies can be 'inflated'. I don't expect to be able to waltz into Meta and interview for the Head of Design role, and this is not my goal. I am currently only applying for IC roles (e.g. Senior UX Designer). Some comments here suggest that it might be wise to adjust my ‚ÄòHead of‚Äô titles on my CV to better align with the wider industry norms. I‚Äôll give that a shot. Thanks, everyone!	92	137

My strengths lie in visual design, prototyping, interaction design. I‚Äôm learning front end development as well and I particularly lovee design mobile apps! I know the app space is super competitive and there might not be as many opportunities out there, compared to the B2B space. But I‚Äôm just feeling too drained having to fight everyday for visual design and user experience  - all the companies I worked for did not care about them too much, as long as the feature does not suck and customers don‚Äôt scream about them. I understand them from a business pov, but it certainly drained me, and suck the joy and love out of me. \n\nI‚Äôm trying to accept the reality and not stressing too much about it. But I get more and more unmotivated everyday. I don‚Äôt know why I am needed here, except to design solutions only for it to be torn apart, ‚Äúscope cut‚Äù they said. Since changing mindset does not work, I‚Äôm considering looking for opportunities outside of SaaS / B2B designs. \n\nMy question is: How should I approach this transition. 100% of my real, shipped design work are B2B webapps. I have a few pet projects that are mobile apps. With 3 years of experience, what should I expect if I want to make the transition? Will I be considered less experienced if I apply for an app design role? Any advice or thoughts would be be greatly appreciated üôèüèª	8	9

Although it's really scary leaving a fully remote job for this and having to travel long distances twice a week, I've reached the point where I'd rather be happy in a company where design is prioritized than work for a startup where you wear multiple hats.

UXDesign	2024-08-27 21:35:27	1	throwaway932745		UX Research		Hoping the mods allow this. Maybe there's a shot at protecting even ONE person from this vile vile company, since their scheme is still going.	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1f2sx6i/hoping_the_mods_allow_this_maybe_theres_a_shot_at/	Shades (a Gen Z-targeted news app) posted an unpaid, remote UX internship on LinkedIn four weeks ago. You might have seen it, it has 1500+ applications. If you're thinking it's odd a job wouldn't close a posting if they've had it up for a month and have more applicants than they'll ever get through, with 100s more coming in each day, that's because it is. Jeff Grimes (co-founder) is sending applicants the same copy-paste message making them think they beat out others, but it's extremely probable all 1500+ people got/will get that message. It includes an interview form, which not only asks for ideas on where to find research participants, but also a *detailed* response of two things Shades could improve about their app. Literally mining free labor and ideas from thousands of people. Gross. And of course, they end the form by encouraging applicants to leave a 5-star review on the App Store.\n\nGets worse though. When you submit that form, you'll likely get an email/message from Jeff saying you were selected to move forward again. Which in this case means, you guessed it, another written form. The very first question on the form asks you to expand on the two ideas you previously shared and make them bigger and better. Yeah. To add insult to injury, the form requires you to conduct an in-person interview with a stranger and take copious notes. The example notes given to follow were two pages long, single-spaced. We're already far beyond what any paid job would ask of an applicant. But there's more, because why wouldn't there be.\n\nIf you completed all that, Jeff's email says you *might* get a video interview, but based on my experience *plus* three friends I shared the job posting with, *plus* recent anecdotal comments from Reddit users (iirc one had poor spelling and grammar, so the fact he got to round 3 among 1000+ applicants proves how much they really didn't give a f-ck), applicants are ghosted as soon as Shades gets what they wanted, a.k.a. stolen ideas and precious user insights. There's no doubt people spent (and are still spending) several hours completing the forms and generating original ideas for these weasels. If all logic follows, Shades now has a lifetime supply of these forms full of information and ideas, and never had to pay a cent. That's Exploitation with a capital E.\n\nThe nastiest part is that Shades/Jeff (I don't know how many other people even work there tbqh, but it's small) are preying on 100s if not 1000s of people who are hopeful and *really* believe they have a shot at this job because Jeff keeps sending them to the next round. The knife cuts even deeper considering UX jobs are NOT easy to land, and I'm sure Shades knows that many of their applicants are trying insanely hard to make a career for themselves in UX.\n\n**PLEASE, for the love of God, don't give this company free labor.** I think they're all set with their new stockpile of material. And they'll need it, because they clearly don't have a drop of creativity or originality amongst them. That whole app is probably built on stolen ideas.\n\nP.S.: Manipulating applicants by advertising a position with no true intent to fill it, but still using it as bait to get hundreds of hours of free labor for your company should NOT be legal, am I crazy? There need to be real, concrete legal protections put in place for job applicants. It's gross that young people are being taken advantage of by these shameless exploiters because an unpaid internship is the best they can even get in this market. Oh, and here's a fun tidbit! The actual internship requires interviewing a MINIMUM of 80 people (no close friends or family) over 10 weeks, and taking detailed notes for each, of course. Living the (unpaid) dream!\n\n**TLDR:** Shades News is shady, Jeff Grimes is grimey, and for the past month they've been using a UX intern posting to get free labor and creative work from applicants with no apparent intention of hiring. (**EDIT 8/28**: Somebody made a good point that this all may have been to garner app traffic more than anything, which makes a lot of sense. Again, I have no proof they're stealing/ripping off original work. But they are taking it for free! Still sleazy.)	74	425

Some of that was digital product design. None of those are able to be sliced neatly into specific time periods. I am a bit of a generalist based on my background but I want to do specifically digital product design. So how do I answer this question?

I just started on the mobile designs for the web app and I'm wondering the best way to set up the mobile nav.\n\nIdeally it would be great to do a bottom nav like most native apps have, but from some basic initial research I read some posts on stack overflow where a lot of people were saying that they learned the hard way that bottom navs for mobile web run into a lot of issues. \n\nI imagine this is a pretty common UX situation that people run into, so I'd love to hear what best solutions people came up with. \n\nMy first thought would just be to move the bottom nave up to the top, shown below. (the hamburger would open additional links that aren't the 3 primary ones.)  \n  \nIt seems like it works but it feels a bit off.

I‚Äôm expected to walk through my role, the design decisions I made, the trade-offs involved, and reflect on what I might change if I had to do it again.\n* **Future Vision:**¬†They‚Äôve asked me to present my thoughts on how user experience can evolve in the tech space, especially in areas that are currently not ideal. I need to propose a new approach to a problematic user experience and explain my thinking behind it.\n\n# What I‚Äôm Looking For:\n\n**Project Selection**: Any tips on selecting the most impactful project? Should I focus more on technical complexity, innovation, or user impact?\n\n**Presentation Tips**: How should I structure my presentation to effectively convey both my past experience and future vision within a 30-minute timeframe?\n\n**Design Philosophy**: When discussing how I would improve a subpar user experience, what frameworks or thought processes would you recommend I use to articulate my ideas clearly and persuasively?\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear how others have approached similar challenges. Any advice, resources, or personal experiences you could share would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance for your help!	5	6

I feel so alone (long)	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1f07lsu/need_advice_should_i_stay_in_design_do_i_leave/	Hey my lovely people, I need to get some advice. \n\nI really love this field. I worked very hard to get here. I know we all have. But I didn‚Äôt have the option to go to college. I taught myself, then did a bootcamp (yeah, trust me, I know, absolutely trash) continued to teach myself even more, and managed to get a job. \n\nI was an interactive designer. Then I left, started in startup as ux/ui designer, promoted to senior, was given title of lead (I don‚Äôt have the skill set to be considered a lead), ran their design team, marketing team, branding etc everything creative and visual.  \n\nI‚Äôve been on projects for Fortune 500 companies, I‚Äôve done enterprise, consumer facing, web apps, mobile apps, VUI / conversational design, automotive designs (seats / huds / apps etc) I have led and worked on multiple native apps, at  least 3 on the play/ App Store for public and multiple web ones that aren‚Äôt.  \n\nI was laid off because the startup ceo essentially made a lot of bad choices and tanked his company. I should have bailed a long time ago. I didn‚Äôt. \n\nThis market is brutal. I have been rejected so many times my imposter syndrome is through the roof. I feel like I don‚Äôt have a place here in this career field. It‚Äôs only been about 2 months, but I‚Äôm starting to doubt if I should continue to try to be here.  \n\nI feel so burnt out. I don‚Äôt think I can survive interviews even if I get one. Especially when they want you to do a portfolio walk through, take home project and multiple interviews. \n\nEven if I do end up super lucky and get a job  is it going to be like before? The start up treated the developers like gods and never held them accountable for anything and they constantly disrespected me. I was never allowed to do my full process. \n\nI don‚Äôt know if I have the oomf to keep going. To stay up with tech, be doubted 24/7, fight to be allowed to do my job correctly, to be worried about being laid off again. \n\nI feel like I don‚Äôt belong here, even though I desperately am trying to be. I have multiple chronic illnesses, so I have to be remote. Which I feel is also hurting me in my hunt. \n\nI guess the TLDR is: \n\nI‚Äôll take any advice. I feel so lost. And tired. I‚Äôm so exhausted of putting in overtime and trying to prove myself. I just want to do my job and get my bills paid.\n\nWhat other careers are verticals to ux/ui? I‚Äôm not cut throat enough. Do I leave? Where do I go? I thought I finally found my career and was getting a break in life. \n\nIf you made it this far you‚Äôre my hero. Thanks for letting me scream into the void.	59	91

User has to switch tabs to view details of each sample one-by-one.\n\nSo, my concern is that I have to redo that screen where the user can compare the results of all samples and in both the phases in a single view.

I recently joined a new company where I was excited to contribute and make a difference. However, things have gone downhill since I started, and I‚Äôm feeling really lost and unsupported.\n\nHere‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening:\n\nBullying by a Senior Team Member: There‚Äôs a senior member on my team who constantly dismisses my ideas and contributions, even going as far as to publicly criticize me. I‚Äôve tried to address the situation with my manager and HR, but so far, nothing has changed. It feels like my concerns are not taken seriously.\n\nHealth Issues and Lack of Accommodation: I have a chronic health condition that causes severe pain and anxiety. I‚Äôve communicated my needs and absences due to this condition, but I‚Äôve only received pushback from my team and HR. HR has been condescending, and instead of helping, they‚Äôve suggested I need to handle things differently. This is taking a toll on my mental and physical health. (Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and AuDHD)\n\nFeeling Undervalued and Overlooked: Despite being hired for a specialized role, I often feel like my input is an afterthought. My work gets ignored or dismissed, and I‚Äôve even had to watch as my contributions are sidelined for reasons I don‚Äôt understand. I suggested hiring another person with my skill set to provide better support, but that was ignored too.\n\nConfusing Work Environment and Mixed Messages: The work environment is chaotic, and I‚Äôm constantly getting mixed messages from different leaders. I‚Äôm told to prioritize certain tasks, only for others to be deemed more critical without warning. This has left me feeling confused and overwhelmed.\n\nDocumentation and Efforts Going Unnoticed: I‚Äôve documented all my efforts to address these issues and provided detailed work and research to improve our team‚Äôs processes, but it feels like none of it is appreciated. Instead, I‚Äôm accused of being uncommitted or not doing my job.\n\nHealth Impact: I‚Äôve even had to take days off due to severe pain, but instead of understanding, my absences are held against me. I‚Äôm being treated like a junior employee, despite being brought in as an expert in my field.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to resign because I genuinely believe in the work we‚Äôre doing, but I also don‚Äôt want to ignore my health any longer. I‚Äôve tried everything I can think of to improve the situation, but nothing seems to work. I feel like I‚Äôm at a breaking point and don‚Äôt know who to turn to.\n\nWhat should I do next? How can I address the bullying effectively, and ensure my role and contributions are respected? Has anyone else been in a similar situation and found a way out?\n\nThanks for any advice or support you can provide. I really appreciate it.\n\nTL;DR: I'm experiencing bullying from a senior team member at work, and despite reporting it to my manager and HR, nothing has been done. My health is deteriorating due to stress, and HR hasn't been helpful with accommodations. I feel undervalued and ignored in my role, which is affecting my mental and physical well-being. I don‚Äôt want to quit, but I‚Äôm not sure how to improve the situation. Any advice on how to handle this or where to turn next would be greatly appreciated.\n\n(Also posted in /AskHR, /Workplace_bullying, /antiwork, /careerguidance, and /Advice)	9	5

I've asked a few people in my circle, but I'd love to hear what you all think.\n\nCurrently, I'm in a role that I really love at a company working on some interesting subject matter. I came across this job after being laid off from a large tech company and spending a brief, exciting, but somewhat rocky time at a startup. While the role offers some fascinating projects, the pay isn't close to what I was previously making. Despite living in a high-cost city, I've managed so far.\n\nRecently, recruiters approached me with some intriguing opportunities. Out of curiosity, I started the early interview process, and one role, in particular, offers significant ""ikigai"" lifestyle potential and much better pay. Unfortunately, I was recently taken off a project I was excited about‚Äînot due to performance, as I'm doing very well, but because my current team lacks the influence to keep me on this high-impact project. I'm staying on as a part-time consultant, but I feel the company is missing out by not leveraging my expertise. I'm also bummed I'm not going to have this project in my portfolio. This makes me consider whether I should ""vote with my feet,"" though I worry I might be letting my ego get in the way.\n\nMy previous role was a short tenure, the shortest I've ever had in a full-time position, and I felt embarrassed about it. Before that, I was at a large tech company for four years, which I believe shows my loyalty. There are many reasons for the short tenure, which I can share if people are curious, but I'll keep details anonymous for now.I haven't been in this current role for a year yet, and I don't want to be seen as a job-hopper. However, it seems foolish not to pursue an obviously better opportunity. Additionally, my current role is relocating offices, which will significantly impact my quality of life by more than tripling my commute time over an expensive toll-bridge. This feels relevant to my decision to consider other options.\n\nWhat do you all think? Have you faced a similar challenge? I'm very concerned about my industry reputation and want to be seen as a reliable colleague and employee. It would really bother me if I were thought of as a flake or an opportunist, or if I did something that hurt my reputation or brand.¬†But the other role is enticing and I'm still going through the interview process since it seems silly not to, if only for practice, but I feel fraudulent or unethical while I'm doing it :(. Have any of you faced a similar challenge and if so what do you think about short stints or evaluating candidates with short stints?"	6	3

Now they're doing a complete software overhaul, all in-house and have grandiose ideas about implementing AI models and automating a lot of the work we do.

Upper management loves to emphasize the importance of usability and how it can cost us millions if done poorly but they have no designers or researchers on the team.

Usually, they have me email the recruiter basic demographic information (name, DOB, city/state), references, and attach my resume and portfolio. This morning they called with an opportunity at a large financial institution. They said the need to fill this role was urgent, and I would be interviewed by said institution within the next 24 hrs. The timeline is odd, but the rest seems standard for recruiter experiences. It's also worth noting that they offered $75/hr for this position whereas they have offered $55-$65 in the past. They also did not ask for a portfolio, although I have it linked in my resume. \n\nHowever, when I received email requesting my information, they asked me to send a photo of my drivers license. This would have gone to the recruiter's email, not the financial company's website. When I stated I was not comfortable doing this, they called back and said it was required. When I declined again, he said they would move forward with my application but his manager would reaching out to discuss the license issue.\n\nI have never heard of something like this before.

This is my first post here. I'm looking for some advice.\n\nI've been working as a Product Designer for the past 4 years. I'm now reaching a point where I feel like I could switch projects/companies, but for that, I need to redo my portfolio. The ones I had before were more junior, and were based on more start up projects with limited budget.\n\nNow, since I'm working in a bigger corporation, I've been responsible for making the core product work better, but since it's a visual editor, I've been working on features like cropping, shadows, enabling basic text features, etc. - nothing that revolutionary or creative. Yet, that's still 2+ years of experience working there and getting noticeable results in activation. The problem is that it's driving activation, because the product before was... well, not great. If I put in my portfolio that I brought bullet point list into a product and it works like any other bullet point list, that won't impress anybody. It's also none of the big name companies, where the name of the company could raise some interest.\n\nMy question is: how do you present the long term projects that make the product better, but aren't big redesigns or very innovative features?

Some of these jerks aren't even in the UX sphere - they're just mouth breathers that are in some group they don't give a damn about. \n\nI'm sure I'm going to get flamed by these jerks because they're like cockroaches.

On those projects I was the one creating design system, but for this new project I would like to use a design kit if possible. Now for the past two years I am mostly working on e-commerce projects. \n\nMy question is, how do you organize screens on large projects? \n\nBefore, when I was working on SaaS projects it was mostly like one design file, and inside I would create multiple pages. Each page would be for each let's say page in the navigation bar. \n\nBut then for other project I would create two or three design projects, first where I just use design file to work on it, and second design file where is the final design and ready for developers to work on them. \n\nNow I would like to hear what's your approach to this, and also, do you have any good UI kits to recommend which I could take a look at it? Mainly I am looking for UI kit with good dashboard, data visualisation and user management components. \n\nThanks in advance. \n\n	1	0

UXDesign	2024-08-20 20:40:48		SirCharlesEquine	Veteran	Senior careers		Changing Director and Assoc. Director titles on resume to Principal / Lead Designer. Any advice or thoughts?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1ex6ej2/changing_director_and_assoc_director_titles_on/	I'm currently out of work and was laid off in March. I work in content marketing as a UX designer and strategist, focused primarily on websites, content hubs, and digital editorial content design.\n\nI was promoted to Assoc. Director in 2017, and Director in 2022, but was essentially a team of one helping lead multidisciplinary teams on projects from beginning to end from 2019 to 2024 when I was laid off. Unlike those titles at other agencies, I didn't manage people, didn't have direct reports, but was indeed involved in pitching, new business opportunity ideation, organic growth with existing clients, I mentored younger junior designers on the creative team, and did a lot to improve our design process, evolve to use more cloud-based design tools, and was big into keeping our creative team inspired with great work from around the web.\n\nI am of course looking for new opportunities at equivalent title levels, but I worry that any company considering me for those titles will expect a bit more experience than I have. As more of an IC type of designer, I see myself as a bit more of a principal or lead designer (and really wish that I'd asked for those titles when I was promoted in the past). I do aspire to continue working towards management and leadership level positions where I'd for sure be a director, but my question is...\n\nIs there any harm in changing those titles on my resume to Lead or Principal designer, and explaining that I had different titles, but that being a lead or principal is really more of what I was? Have any of you worked around issues like that when looking for work?  I'm looking for all kinds of opportunities and don't at all mind a simple UX Designer position as long as it offers good opportunity and the $ is what I need it to be.\n\nI really appreciate your advice!	22	0

The s(hi)tuation is more complicated than I thought. \n\nI noticed the main issue is neither on the legacy product itself nor devs (devs are still causing issues, but they are not the primary concern now). It's actually with the culture of the company (sales-driven), sales team and my supervisor (who is a project manager but pretty biased towards sales). \n\nAs per some of the redditors suggested in previous thread, I tried to follow devs' way of doing things (since they can treat 'UI redesign' as a big project), proposed some clutter reduction and attempted to paint fresh coat of paint over it, and propose incremental flow optimizations. \n\nHowever, recently sales took **all** the feedback from customers (including those who haven't signed on) and shove everything to me as ""feature requests"" without considering the limitations of this legacy software and the impact/benefits towards this product. Some of their requests are just not value-adding to the product, I tried reasoning with my supervisor only to end up quarrelling with him. So the devs and I have to 100% listen to him, prioritize developing features and features over the main problem (which is the shitty UI and complicated flow). It has resulted in a shittier and extremely feature-bloated software, and lesser customers signed on. A few current customers even gave up on this software and decided to pull out from it because their feedback is ""too complicated"". \n\nI attempted to voice out the main issue to the big boss as a last resort, however the boss is also sales-driven and says ""complexity is the way to go"". I had multiple conflicts with supervisor on scope creep and feature creep, only to get his ultimatum feedback ""SHUT UP and JUST DO IT. Let the devs figure their way, your job is just design"". My mental sanity has been draining rapidly because this product is a sinking ship stuck in a product death cycle loop, and this company is just treating me as a feature factory. \n\nHow to survive in a company that is a feature factory? Is it time to move on? I don't even want to display this product in my portfolio."	14	3

I want  to learn more design, but I find the overhead to learn Figma well is quite high - but I think the prototyping feature is useful, to test things before MVP\n\nI‚Äôve done one HCI class- learnt about lofi prototyping and really enjoyed it because I think the sort of feedback you get on lofi prototype instead of hifidelity prototype is different.

I‚Äôve heard people just use Figma to make lofi prototypes but frankly I think if you just plonk someone with Figma they will feel lost.

Meaning, don‚Äôt put in code for features that you expect will be added in the future.\n* KISS. Keep it simple, stupid. Don‚Äôt try to be clever (even if you are).

UXDesign	2024-08-19 03:14:53		DiscoMonkeyz	UX writer	UX Research		Is SaaS the wrong place to worry about usability?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1evrrth/is_saas_the_wrong_place_to_worry_about_usability/	I work for a SaaS company that never does any research or testing. 90% of the features we build are requested by large customers. But there's no one measuring whether or not they're even being used. Or how easy they are to use. Or if they solve anyone's problem other than the 1 customer who requested the feature.  \n  \nThe overall product is a bit of a nightmare to use, in my opinion. As the UX writer it's left up to me to explain how things work. Half the time I can see an alternative way to do things, but as the writer I'm just ignored or overruled, and then left trying to explain why X does Y (or why it doesn't do Z like you'd expect).  \n\n\nThe problem is, we get plenty of negative feedback from customers reiterating the problems I've pointed out in the first place.   \n  \nBut, this is the first SaaS company I've worked for. So, is this just how Saas companies usually run? Do we just put out new features and wait for the customers to tell us they're hard to use and then fix them later?   \n  \nIs there anything I can do as the writer to try and improve the usability when we have no budget for research and testing? Or should I just stop caring about usability and focus on getting features shipped?\n\n	14	15

UXDesign	2024-08-18 11:54:18		babbageio		Senior careers		I am a con-designer	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1ev7gay/i_am_a_condesigner/	"Hey there, this is a throw-away account.\n\nSo, if you are wondering if one is a con-designer then one probably is one?!\n\n**Background**\n\nI have been in Product Design for 8 years now. Having no formal training in the UX or tech field I created a fake portfolio to get into the industry at the beginning to get my first gig. Prior I worked as a construction worker and taught myself Sketch and design theory at night.\n\nSince then I had multiple jobs in the industry. Ranging from small local start-ups (I live in Europe) to 2nd (3rd?!) tier tech companies from Silicon Valley.\n\nHowever, I was never able to stay at a job for longer than 1.5 years. I always quit because I am scared I will be found out as the con that I am. In every company, there was little actual design work from me that was shipped. Most of the time I have done a lot of research, facilitated workshops, was involved in design and product vision/strategy formulation, and concerned myself with design team growth initiatives (DesignOps, hiring playbooks, planning offsite, etc.)\n\nIn every company, I got good performance reviews. There was never a performance review that was not rated ""above expectations"". However, I believe this as well is due to me being able to sell myself well, or for lack of design org maturity. Basically, design managers who would not know how to properly assess performance accurately.\n\nMy UI skills are lacking. If I were put on the spot in a real interview situation to come up with a solution, I think I would be able to produce something and show my problem-solving skills. Even if not very smoothly. But if the interviewee would then ask me to design something live in Figma I would fail miserably.\n\nRight now I am working as a Senior Designer. My portfolio is heavily embellished (no fake projects though). I always felt that I was just getting the gigs because I am very good at selling myself in interviews and because there are no live design challenges.\n\nMy therapist continues to work with me on my self-worth issues and imposter syndrome.\n\nStill, I believe I am not a good designer and that I am a con artist because I have never done a real design project from start to finish that was actually shipped. Only smaller features. But now I am already a senior and frankly I need the money to provide for my family. For me design is just a job, I don't care too much about it. It is mostly the money, tbh. I literally need to put food on the table for a lot of family members (I am from a poor eastern European country)\n\nI do try to improve every day by copy work, improving Figma efficiency, reading a shit ton (design theory, design leadership, systems thinking), and engaging with the community. Since I started 8 years ago I also got a BA and MS in business part-time. But it feels like as second job now to become on par with my job title. \n\nSo, am I a con artist? How can I go about it to change that? Should I go back to junior-to-mid-level jobs? Should I leave design because I just care about money? It is hard to put in words but the situation is just so exhausting. I am questioning myself every day.\n\nAny suggestion about how to go about it would be much appreciated. Especially from your experienced design manager out there. How would you coach someone like me?"	141	172

There's not much to enjoy. It's just more components and elements each time. Not much variation or creativity in it really.\n\nSo my question is how can I remain in UI/UX design and enjoy it being a very visual kind of designer and less strategic, and needing more creativity and variation in what I do rather than just the same restrictive stuff time and time again?\n\nOr do I need to pivot to a different area of design like graphic design, branding, motion, 3D etc?	18	2

I never used to watch relationship content, I do now. Literally every suggested post is relationship stuff, every single 1 not 1 non-relationship suggested post. This isn't the case on TT, it seems TT looks to throw in random tangentially related things which are actually great. Let's say for example you're into interior design, instead of seeing inside people's homes, it'll show people who make custom home fixtures/furniture or interior house plants. Instagram will literally just show you more and more interiors.\n3. **I thought this was a photo app?** As an amateur photographer, I can name the number of people from my city who've literally come up on instagram in it's early days (2012-2018). It was a special time. I saw friends go from selling their sneaker collection, to buying DSLRs, and posting wicked shots of cityscapes daily to having big brands like Adidas, Pro Sports Teams, Canon, and Magazines reaching out to them. They became full time photogs and feed their families now thanks to instagram.\n4. **You can't pause reels, and the muting feature is broken.** Another post in this thread mentioned muting something on IG is so hard and cumbersome for literally no reason. It's becoming an obnoxious app that when you open in public you're like FML. Tiktok has a simple mute on open feature that you choose in the settings. Boom, solved.\n\nTLDR; I used to love the photo-first features of Instagram, and they've slowly got rid of everything that I loved them for. I think TikTok is much better, even in their algorithim and in their user controls. Instagram is becoming insufferable imho.\n\n  \nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk. \n\nEdit: vastly superior was a reach.	116	329

I wanted an opinion on how best to go about finding work in my situation.\n\nIn 2019 I graduated with a certificate in UX after completing a 12 week bootcamp and applied for jobs but got caught in the wave of the pandemic and never ended up finding any work. Fast forward to six years later, 2024, I lost all motivation to get back into looking for UX jobs and have been trudging through with warehouse/factory work. \n\nI recently enrolled in the Google UX certificate and have been doing that in my free time. I've heard that while it is good for learning theory, that on its own won't exactly land you a job as it doesn't provide any practical experience. In the end I got halfway through but haven't ended up finishing it for that reason. \nI'm seriously considering quitting my job and taking up a 12-week bootcamp to refresh my knowledge and practical skills in UX and I honestly think that it'll be my best bet at getting job ready.\n\nThat said, I've also been advised that even though it has been 6 years, I still have the skills for UX. All I'd need to do is refresh my knowledge via the Google UX certificate, and then start applying for jobs. While that definitely appeals to me, I still won't have had any sort of recent practical experience to supplement that. My resume has my bootcamp experience from 2019 and even though I still use it to apply for UX roles, I'm not too sure if its helping at all. I've also been getting reacquainted with Figma and have been trying to get some newer works into my portfolio using client generators like FakeClients. \n\nI'm even looking into doing a couple personal projects for practical experience, but I'm not sure how to go about it.\n\nI've put through so many applications on Indeed, Seek and Jora for internships and junior UX roles (when I can find them), and I'm not even sure if I'm doing the right thing by applying for only these kinds of roles? Should I also be applying for mid level and senior positions just to get my numbers up? Where even is the best place to find graduate roles?? Are there any similar roles that I should be applying for that'll serve as good experience in applying for a UX role?\n\nWhat would the best course of action be for me? Should I just go all in again, do another bootcamp and re-learn everything from scratch, or should I keep trying to use my existing (but kinda dated) experience as a base to refresh and then apply for more jobs?\n\nI feel so despondent and worthless to be completely honest. I'll be turning 26 this year and it feels like I've truly messed up by leaving things this long. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nTLDR; Did a UX bootcamp in 2019 and the pandemic hit so I couldn't find any UX jobs. Want to get back into it now and wanted to know how best to do it.	15	4

For the most part, I‚Äôve enjoyed it. Ive had some flexibility to move around and take some extended time off between jobs. \nNow, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if my time contracting is hurting my chances to grow as a designer and find work. \n\nMy previous contract was the first time working for a large, well known tech company. The team was great but most of my work involved supporting busy FTE‚Äôs and doing the projects they didn‚Äôt have time for. It was mostly minor feature improvements, with no user research or testing. It felt like I pushed pixels most of my time there which doesn‚Äôt really lead to compelling case studies. \n\nThis is quite frustrating as I now look for work. I thought I could leave the contract with at least one strong case study but right now I‚Äôm struggling.\n\nCurious if this is a common experience when contracting for large tech or FAANG companies at a mid/senior level. Has anyone else struggled putting together portfolio worthy case study projects after contracting? And how does this look from a hiring managers POV if I there are very few full time roles on my resume?  \n	9	12

UXDesign	2024-08-13 21:11:15		jeffreyaccount	Veteran	Senior careers		Ideas for how to suck it up, keep calm and do a Design Challenge	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1erj0cv/ideas_for_how_to_suck_it_up_keep_calm_and_do_a/	"I have three companies right now interested in hiring me. I've been applying to roles over the past year and a month. I have had a few small projects, and I tried to do a design challenge a month ago.\n\nI took a look at every designer on LI and the hiring manager. It was 0 for 7 portfolio-wise on Linkedin and Google Search. The HM did have a portfolio at one point but was a dead link. Most of the people were fairly new to UX and live in the home office area. I couldn't do it. I was so mad, confused by the 4 sentence task, and not sure how I'd spend two hours designing something and then defend and workshop it with them for an hour. I just pulled out citing all the reasons above, and did not get into my philosophy on design challenges as a whole.\n\nMy background- 15 years advertising and design art director (I dont care about the visual layer one bit right now, since UX is so poor‚Äîlet's make it work first, then make it 'cool' if it matters), 9 years UX Design, 4 UX Research and 3 UX Strategy. 19 of the Fortune 500. I have 15 highly annotated case studies ranging from user testing, application model creation, UI design, user interviews, and I have a mapping of all my methods and which applied to each job.\n\nSo now, present day:\n\n1) The first wants me to review their app in its current state, and give ideas to improve it. No hiring manager portfolio, but did work inhouse at a health care company for 25 years. Also has the title ""Creative Director"", and that role itself is worry‚Äîno research. The bosses just want ideas and building things. No testing, and I asked how do you understand if it's working or not? It's a startup and each team figures out what to build, so it's really all UI. This is likely the easiest challenge, but I am actively doing work by reviewing it. But this one has a third red flag‚Äîit's going to be marketed to health care companies, but the idea is to crowdsource treatments from patients. If you have a diagnosis, you can connect to this social network for ideas to help with your issue. Everyone contributes, no doctor oversight, but the idea is to circumvent or add options of home care via other people using the app. Kind of like Reddit has channels. The mission is interesting, but not based in science or medicine‚Äîbut others' methods of self care or support. I see both sides of it as I have a few chronic conditions were doctors dont say or do much. (They are complex issues.) (Also I think in this case from my metrics, the HM saw my resume and either spent no time on my site except the home page, or spent 30 seconds.)\n\n2) Numero Dos just sent me two options‚Äîboth are two hours work, one hour presentation. One is to redesign something I saw and didn't like. The other is a leadership app, where mentees can sign up to learn from executives and how to make it engaging. Again, no research or any data to start with. I did have a project where I did something similar, and may just say ""guess what? I have something in my portfolio"" or keep it to myself and spill out my real work along the way. This one I want to see their site, because again, no UX portfolios.\n\n3) Pending... we will see what their technical interview portion is.\n\n  \nSo how do I keep from blowing up, or trying to teach them lessons? Any success stories? And how do you fill an hour? Everything thus far in all three roles are basically UI jobs from what I am gathering. I did two in person way back and I was as confused as the interviewers. I swore not to do them again and turned down 3-4 in the past year even in the bad market.\n\nI also do discovery research projects, and am thinking about number two just taking my direction, directives in the final deck and exploring that as a design UI task.\n\nI know my future if I decline the exercises. Just back to the pavement. It's been really quiet jobwise, but it sounds like all three of these are active and would like to get someone hired quickly. \n\nAny help, commiseration, techniques you might have done, or frankly if you say ""duck out"" of the interview process, that's cool with me.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n"	15	2

Serving multiple stakeholders: We serve not just users, but also our employers, shareholders, and the business as a whole. Recognizing this can help us make more holistic design decisions.\n2. Profitability focus: With tech companies increasingly prioritizing profitability, designers need to remember that we're contributors to the bottom line. Our work isn't just about creating beautiful interfaces; it's about driving business results.\n3. Time constraints are real: Spending countless hours on exploration and iteration simply isn't realistic in today's fast-paced tech environment. We need to balance creativity with efficiency.\n4. Business acumen is crucial: I believe designers would greatly benefit from business education. Understanding financials, market dynamics, and strategic planning can help us make more impactful decisions and communicate our value more effectively.\n5. Measurable outcomes: Like any service, our work should be measured by its outcomes ‚Äì user satisfaction, increased conversions, reduced support tickets, etc. These metrics tie directly to business success.\n6. Adaptability is key: The tech industry moves fast. As service providers, we need to be quick to adapt to new technologies, market changes, and evolving business needs.\n\nEmbracing design as a service doesn't diminish its importance and enterprise design is not dead. If anything, it elevates our role by directly tying our work to business success. It's time we stop seeing ""service"" as a dirty word and start leveraging this mindset to increase our impact and value in the tech industry.\n\nI'm curious to get everyone's thoughts on this."	59	46

This post is more of me ""thinking out loud"" than it is trying to convince anyone of anything. Happy to hear others' opinions.\n\nMy background is I was a career UX designer from 2014 - 2024. I've worked in both consumer and enterprise UX, both in-house and at an agency. I've worked at companies with thousands of employees and I was employee number 8 at a startup.\n\nUX leaders like Jared Spool and others are pushing UX designers to think more about business goals and ROI. I hate this because in my opinion it means most features never get the attention they deserve. Focusing on business goals makes UX designers more like project managers. You're always chasing whatever the new ""shiny"" thing is, or what the investors say is important that quarter. Because taking a feature from good to great doesn't bring in new revenue, it rarely happens on a large scale. Small features sure, but larger cross-product features almost never.\n\nIt means projects get dropped, teams get dropped/restructured, features are left half baked. You build something ""good enough"" to convince new customers to join, but leave them with a mediocre experience while you're off building the next thing.\n\nHere's an example, in my five years at a large enterprise company (dev-ops) it was well-known that our notification system was awful. Notifications are important for a developer to understand what they need to focus on, or problems they need to address, etc. We tried so many times to fix it, even implement a basic notification system, but it never went anywhere because it wasn't a business goal.\n\nAside from this experience, I was moved around 5 times during those 5 years, never because of poor performance, always because of restructuring and refocusing goals. This sucked because I was never able to experience any sort of longevity or security on any team, which is horrible for my resume.\n\nI don't know, I feel pretty jaded about our industry and the ""experts"" who push these philosophies on us. I was actually fortunate to get out of the industry and hope I never have to go back. And if I do, I would rather work for a smaller consumer-focused company that doesn't feel ""techy"".\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n**Edit**\n\nI appreciate the input here. It helps me sort out my own thoughts. After reading everyone's feedback, I think a better title might have been ""Are UX designers just becoming PMs and is that bad?"" Or something like that. I definitely don't disagree that UX can and should impact bottom line. That's always been the case. This post mostly stemmed from me noticing the way we talk about UX changing, which then correlated with what I was seeing in big tech both around me, and in the horribly designed products that are built by companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., who claim to be the industry design leaders."	67	108

This may result in perceived simpler information architecture: instead of having to explore 3 or 4 complex sections with sub-menus and sections, you only need to explore one. The information hierarchy is also more clear: top = important, bottom = less important. I would assume that once users are familiar with it, the app would feel more accessible and easier to browse.\n\nThis change reminds me of the moment we simplified website architectures around 2014-2015, going from dozens of smaller pages with a massive menu, to a simpler one-page structure whenever possible.\n\nWhat other popular apps adopted this practice? I can think of Apple Notes, ChatGPT, Noms... Which other comes to your mind?	38	37

UXDesign	2024-08-11 17:33:52		rightcreative		UX Strategy & Management		Struggling with the UX of a custom component. Could use some outside perspective.	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1epqhvy/struggling_with_the_ux_of_a_custom_component/	"I am working on building a component that allows users to enter their top 5 favorites of a category, and rank them in order.\n\nOn the backend, we will be keeping score of the votes, and showing the results after someone submits their entry.\n\nWith this component, there is a tricky balance between giving users ""freedom"" to enter whatever they like, but also keeping entries consistent.\n\nFor example¬†‚Äì if we're doing a poll on the top 80's Rock Bands... one person might enter ""Def Leppard"". Another person might enter ""Deaf Leppard"". And yet another person might enter ""Def Leopard"".\n\nAll three entries are for the same band ‚Äì but, because of misspellings, we get three unique entries.\n\nThis would create skewed results, and prevent us from scoring entries accurately.\n\ni.e. we might have 100 combined votes for variations of ""Def Leppard"", but only 75 votes for something simpler, like ""Poison"". In this scenario, ""Poison"" would be ranked higher even though ""Def Leppard"" technically got more votes.\n\nTo help remedy this, I have decided to put an autocomplete in place that providers users options to choose from as they start typing.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that they will click on one of those options. For example... if they start typing ""Mot"", an autocomplete might come up for ""M√∂tley Cr√ºe"". Instead of clicking on it, they might just proceed to type ""Motley Crue"" ‚Äì which again... is the same band, but a variation in spelling (given the special characters of the autocomplete suggestion).\n\nAdditionally ‚Äì someone may want to enter a band that isn't even in the autocomplete list. I want to give them the freedom to do that, if they want. Who knows ‚Äì maybe the band they played in in college is legitimately one of their favorite 80's Rock Bands. ü§∑\n\nSo ‚Äì I am struggling to figure out the right balance on how to best approach this.\n\nA couple of options I had considered include:\n\n‚Ä¢ Putting validation in place as soon as they exit the field. If the value they entered does not match an item in the autocomplete, it shows up as red. The only downside to this approach is that it would discourage people from putting values in that are not on the autocomplete list.\n\n‚Ä¢ Using a dropdown menu instead of an autocomplete. I really don't like this option though, and would prefer to avoid it if possible.\n\n----\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is there a better way for me to go about this? Would love some outside perspective on ways that I could make this into a better user experience.\n\n[Screenshot of the current iteration](https://preview.redd.it/yc4907baj2id1.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=d84d4d0b4120a3d87e55cf11fa74728bb704ed13)\n\n"	5	3

The page is a sign-up page for our client to access our dashboard to manage their ongoing projects. We have a crowd-sourcing app - that connects freelancers/ service providers to clients requesting for services on our website. The page requires clients to fill in fields like - Name, company name,¬†**work email id**¬†and mobile number. We have put a validation on the email id field to reject submissions with personal email ids (gmail, yahoo, Hotmail etc). Now the problem is that service providers end up coming on this sign up page somehow through Google search and before realizing that this page is not for them but for our clients they start filling in the form fields. Since most of these service providers don't have work/official email ids, they cannot submit. They get frustrated and send emails to support saying we didn't provide them company email id hence they aren't able to sign up etc.\n\nWhat are the different ways I can tackle this issue? How can I effectively educate them that this page is not for them?	2	1

During the call he showed very good interest in me and has told me there will be a small assignment, I was stupid and accepted it by the way he told me ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and all sugarcoated genuine interest he showed. Stupid me. \nWell the assignment came which was directly a part of their product and it was fucking huge ass sh*t including tablet mobile desktop to be delivered in 2 days. I did it because I had no other choice but to get something in hand, I knew the assignment scam going on all over. But argh.

There are two senior designers and I‚Äôm the incoming junior. They didn‚Äôt interview or know me before i joined because I interviewed for a different team and was offered to join this one since the other team shelved the opening. Anyway, the seniors here have been resistant to set up meetings to go over designs and for learning, and they take forever to respond or leave me on read on teams. When i ask them to show me some design practices that the team follows, they‚Äôre just super curt with the response and refuse to show me anything. They also act way friendlier to other managers but cold with me. I don‚Äôt know why this is happening and just want to ask for some possible explanations here, and if anyone has experience the same thing. Also, This company does a lot of lay offs so i dont know if this is a possible explanation for the gatekeeping.	40	38

Part of my current job efforts is evangelization and inserting more UX processes into the new product development process. We're currently working through the process of a new design system but completion is a year or two in the future. It's rough.\n\nRecently I was put on a project where they pretty much already designed the product (basically, an auxillary display for an industrial vehicle) then asked for the ""pretty UI"" to go on top of it. Unsurprisingly, the engineering team designed the function completely counter to what our standard UI guidelines suggest. But I talked with them through the specs they needed and gave them a full UI flow to meet their needs. And subsequently got asked for a couple new features here and there. Things seemed alright.\n\nI was OOTO for a bit traveling for business. When I came back a few weeks later, I was blindsided being asked for UI screenshots for a manual, so I ask to see the implementation and it is completely wrong. Basically, using some of the components I provided but, well, it was kludged together in a fashion that looks like a dev did it, is the best way I can describe it. That implementation can't go into production and I certainly can't provide inaccurate photos for the manual.\n\nSo I've been trying to go back and forth with this front end developer to fix it. This particular team member is a third party contractor. And now that I've been seeing more of the implemented screens, I'm seeing that he didn't follow my UI spec and just implemented whatever he wanted, including making some of his own assets (which are completely different colors than our brand). I've told him repeatedly to let me know if he has any questions, but he either doesn't ask questions or fails to ask the questions he actually needs the answers to - just seems to go on his gut rather than any specs and never questions it.\n\nIt took a ton of effort to politely get him to tell me what issues he's running into in implementation, one of which is that he actually uses bitmaps, so pngs with transparency don't work. (Would have been nice to know that the moment he started implementing things so I could fix the problem early on, right?) He also sent an email with some assets he made, asking for replacements - I had to ask for the context, of course. And the screens he sent, again, don't match any of the style guidelines. Just did whatever he wanted.\n\nUnfortunately, the current UI guidelines we have are from over a decade ago and they were made with the limitations of a different type of display (resistive touch, needs to be pressable with gloves on, etc.). Some of the interactions baked into these guidelines are more taps through the menu than the UI this dev suggested. However, we don't have the time or budget to make a completely new UI standard for this one auxiliary product. So sometimes it does feel like I'm being pedantic for suggesting changes that, in some ways, make things seem more complicated (or from his PoV, give him way more tedious work).\n\nLuckily, most of the devs I work with in-house already have their UI development environment set up properly, so it's usually a simple process. But this has been a shitshow. I keep asking the contractor to ask me first before implementing anything, but he still does what he wants. It's a back and forth and although it is professional, it has the vibe of a pissing match. He wants to implement something his way, I am trying to enforce our current UI and branding standards.\n\nFrankly, the core team is wasting their own money by letting this contractor run free without consulting me on UI decisions first. I've tried to communicate that politely. Yet it continues to be an issue.\n\nAny advice on how to deal with this situation?\n\nMy main area of work is actually research, so while I'm senior-level in a research capacity I'm still learning some things about how to function in design.

She hired me to support her and even though I'm only a few weeks in, she's wonderful. \n\nShe works at a another startup part time too which I can't even begin to understand how she does it when I'm overwhelmed at work. Our CEO calls her a fractional design lead.\n\nThis is my first time running into a freelance designer who operates like this. When sr designers who work freelance or PT look for a FT role do hiring managers care that they worked freelance and part time on multiple startups as an independent? \n\nP.S.

Are there articles/books about these topics that you feel you can genuinely rely on?

Recently I've been told by higher ups in a digital products team that the UX team needs to take more initiative in leading what projects the product teams should focus on. Mind you, each product team under the umbrella does not have their specific designer. My team usually discusses with PMs on projects and we decide who takes what on from our team. \n\nThere seems to be a lot of pressure for us to be taking more initiative as a whole team, rather than leaders within it. I am currently a mid-level UX Designer, and from my experience in the past, UX has always been there to support/consult with strategic decisions, not be the ones who have to start it.\n\nCurious what other peoples' experience has been when it comes to strategic planning/collaborative efforts with UX.

For example, to receive feedback from the developers, I need to follow up with them to understand the feasibility of what I've created. Once the design is approved by the product manager, and make changes if necessary, I don't hear anything from the dev team.\n\nI understand this isn't part of the company's culture, but what I often hear are complaints about the design, even if approved before.\n\nAn important issue is that our design has a standard for almost everything, but recently, there have been many things deviating from this standard because we're doing projects that my company it's not used to it. This is causing problems.\n\nI have been trying to gather feedback and have even suggested meetings for each stage, but I haven't been successful yet.

If you don't mind, I would like to ask you a question and get your opinion. I apologize if I shared it in the wrong place.\n\nI have been a technology entrepreneur with a focus on business for 15 years. I am 39 years old and a computer engineer. I have a coding background, I have startup experience and it doesn't take me long to learn something. Let's say 2-3 months. I haven't been writing code for a long time, and frankly I don't like writing that much.\n\nNow here's the problem.\n\nMy design and creative side is also very good. My business model development side is also. I am really good at this side. I have worked on the design side of many startups and given direction. I am also very tired of coding. But this label has stuck to me. People evaluate me from the outside as a software developer. But inside I am in a storm.\n\nI find myself researching design deficiencies and different ideas on the UX side day and night and spending hours on Behance.\n\n\*Do you think I should outsource the coding side like Steve Jobs and focus on the direct design, business model and marketing of the apps? Or should I sit down and do some coding?\n\nEveryone complains about the design side. They talk about not being able to find a job. Frankly, I am not looking for a job.\n\nI want to focus entirely on my own projects for the next 4-5 years. Also, since I have a strong technical background, I can easily analyze which designs will work or not. In addition, on the business side, I can foresee how the customer will perceive that product and how it will be reacted in the market.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation?\n\nAny answer would be greatly appreciated!	0	0

I've got some minimal development experience.  I'm familiar with React. 5 years back frameworks like Tailwind and Shadcn didn't exist. 5 years back auto-layout didn't exist in Figma. Now we've got multi-edit & design tokens. A ton of monotonous work straight out the window. Is it safe to say that there's been a 10x boost in productivity? As a newbie designer looking at these features I just can't help but feel a little sad for the designers who had to work without multiselect. I can't even imagine what it would be like to go back. To painstakingly push things around frame by frame. At the end of the day I am happy about these features. But I feel like we're headed towards a future where there will be less designers needed for every company. Drastically less compared 2010's. Can experience folks chime in?	30	13

I‚Äôd barely get through 2 projects in the course of 50-55m with an intro and all. I showed a lot of process, and a lot more depth.My questions are, when now interviewing for senior or lead roles, how does what you show, change from what you showed when you were a mid-level designer?\nAre you expected to go breadth over depth? i.e in 45-60m, cover three case studies instead?  Don‚Äôt dive too deep into process?Also, do any of ya‚Äôll show large flows in these (just to convey the scale of the project and set up for future slide) or just a few key screens?	8	40

There is no documentation on anything whatsoever (unless it‚Äôs a slidedeck for other parts of the business) but within the technical team, this does not exist. The only documentation sits in the form of jira ticket which is not great practice. It has originally been developer driven which I can understand. \n\nI‚Äôm trying to implement better efficiencies and standards as I have seen so much time wasted asking the same question and there is no way to self serve to obtain info on the multiple products to do our bloody jobs. I‚Äôve discussed this with my PM (she‚Äôs new to the role and has no PM experience/ no exp working with UX or QA) and I‚Äôve kindly asked for a functionality document or to build one out since we‚Äôre starting a new project/ redesigning. She fails to see this value in this and we should just reference tickets to jira as the source of truth. \n\nI know a simple document could make everyone‚Äôs lives easier, take the load off senior leads to answer the same question a million times by different disciplines but also have everyone aligned.

The volatility of the job market the past few years has killed a lot of my initial passion for the work, and as much as I advocate for users and best practices, the companies I've worked for mostly just treat designers really poorly and don't respect UX.

I work in a small design team in a non design forward company where software is a part of the entire hardware suite we have. The engineers get a lot of power and there‚Äôs hardly any investment on design which is frustrating me now. I do have an awesome manager but he‚Äôs not a designer, he‚Äôs a senior PM, and I am afraid I‚Äôm not learning anything much from him or not having enough of an environment to learn from or get inspired from. With being so young in the industry, I really want to move to a proactive team, with a larger investment in design, a more professional approach and a mentor to learn from. \n\nThe more time I spend here, the more independent I am and the more I feel like my growth is stagnant and I‚Äôm falling behind with where the world is going. I‚Äôve made up my mind to look for new roles, but I‚Äôm going through a severe imposter syndrome that I‚Äôve not learnt much or forgotten everything I knew in the last 3 years at this role, and I‚Äôm feeling very demotivated to work on my portfolio. \n\nI am just constantly lingering around the feeling of not being good enough, and all the hard work I did previously in my job hunt is already causing a burn out when I think about how taxing the entire job hunting process is in tech right now. I‚Äôm also considering a hybrid role, and a move to Seattle from Raleigh, to get more exposure and more opportunities. Can you please give me some honest feedback on this? I‚Äôm also severely underpaid and that‚Äôs also a feeling seeping into me everyday. \n\nAfter all the hard work I put into my portfolio, what‚Äôs the chance I will even get one call? Most people, posts I see around are just complaining and not landing even a single interview and even if they do, they‚Äôre getting rejected. \n\nI seriously need some positive reinforcement right now for me to get a head start. I know I‚Äôm capable and I‚Äôm a good designer, but I‚Äôm thinking there are much better designers than me out there and that‚Äôs really intimidating me to a great level.	25	23

But iOS has some nice UX capabilities and and after reading the Apple's Human Interface Design, I am having second thoughts.\n\n**Choices:**\n\n1. No matter the platform, your UI Design System should be consistent. (My business is center of the world).\n2. It is better to respect the platform you are developing for and create a variant of your Design System that takes into both the style of the platform (Hybrid approach: Apple Design + My Design System).\n3. Only respect platform specific features from a UX standpoint, but the UI should be consistent across all platforms\n4. Make a specific UI Design System that adheres exactly to the platform (Platform is King, my iOS app should look like it was made by Apple).\n\nPlatforms that are more generic, like Android idk.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?	4	5

Do startups really use UI kits starting out, or is it better to just create and build your design system from the start.

I come from a graphic design background getting my bachelors in graphic design back in 2016 and I have been told that my UI skills are good to very good, but my UX skills are really weak. I sometimes struggle to explain my decision for a design element.\n\nFor example I can explain things like this:\n\n* You ask why I place that button on the bottom of the page and I would answer the button was placed at the bottom of the page because it‚Äôs easier to reach by the user.\n* You ask why I chose this bright font color over this dark background and I would answer the bright font color was chosen because the background is dark and placing a bright high contrast font color over it would assist the user in being able to read text easier.\n* You ask why is there a back button on the page and I would say that you always want to give the user a way to exit. It allows them to feel like they are in control and when people are in control they feel more comfortable with your design.\n\nBut then if ask how do these changes or design application transfer over to business and profits that's when I struggle. Like when I see people say making this button more visible provides a 200% increase in click rate thus improving profit margins by 50% and I'm just lost lol. Does anyone else feel the same way about themselves too? In the industry is it better to be stronger in UI and weaker in UX or weaker in UI and stronger in UX?	55	66

The PM then got the developer to start building the feature. \n\nOnly after that he decides we should do some user research, so I conducted interviews with our target group. I also suggested speaking with the Finance team (and really pushed for this) to iron out some crucial details as well. So we did. \n\nFast forward half a year and 4 versions later, we‚Äôve completely revamped the project and the changes are huge. Maybe about 70% difference. \n\nNow the PM is passing back to the same dev to get him to work on it again (all in the name of being Agile) and I‚Äôm aware that he‚Äôs not very happy about it lol. \n\nAs a designer, what can I do to help? I thought about using Figma‚Äôs Compare Changes in dev mode but the changes are too drastic for that. I also considered preparing a Before and After file with annotations to help him. But I‚Äôm rushing against time to finish the mobile screens. \n\nWhat are your thoughts/suggestions/advice? Is this normal in Agile? \n\nThanks so much! \n	5	4

I got promoted a few months ago from Senior to Lead and am currently helping out my manager mentor a level 3 designer (not senior).

So I did some digging around, basically just feel out how his process is and we both agree that there are some areas that need work. \n\nHow do I mentor him while not overstepping boundaries? I‚Äôm trying to make him learn at the same time I‚Äôm making sure we are meeting deadlines for product. He is a bit on the slower side of learning. I don‚Äôt want to be a micromanager but the project he is on is already running late and I‚Äôm afraid I will have to step in. \n\nWhat I am currently doing: \n1. I show him my process on how I intake requirements from product and do my UX flow (feature/card sorting, ux flows/journeys, wireframes, research, etc). \n\n2. I am giving him a timeline of what needs to be done for the projects and how I arrange features according to priorities.\n\n3. I am teaching him UX principles and that he should focus more on functionality before UI. Basically trying to keep things simple and to not overthink things.\n\nI am hoping he learns something and figures out his process but I don‚Äôt want us to slack on the projects as he is trying to figure his groove.\n\nAny advice is much appreciated.

I need advise from hiring managers in UX.\n\nCONTEXT:\nI have been rejected from jobs that I felt I was a strong fit to based on my experience and background in those domains. I have held fairly senior level IC positions such as Lead/Principal/Architect and have 14 years of experience (first 4.5 in Industrial Design and rest 9.5 in UX Design). My portfolio also has projects related with ML based product, cloud, SaaS, Insurance, Wealth etc.\n\nSITUATION & RANT:\nI am unable to grasp how having a solid profile and a strong match to several of these enterprise Staff/Senior/Lead etc level positions, I am either not getting HR call or after getting call and passing through 1 or 2 rounds, getting rejected. It wasn't this hard only about 3 years ago. In addition I have some of the renowned academic institution names on my resume. Could you please share where I might lacking? I do have a strong focus on Interaction Design however in my roles, I have delved in research, visual design, testing etc numerous times. I am hoping that for a senior+ level, my profile should stand out. But that may not be the case. \n\nJust very disappointed. Also, from the jobs I was rejected, I strongly felt I would have done a great job because I am so passionate about enterprise UX and the domains I applied to. \n\n\nI AM CONFUSED:\nWhat is happening here? Are visual masters/beauticians taking over and rejecting me? I am just very frustrated so please ignore the cynicism. I am not un-employed but looking for a better fit and work I would love to do. I do have some grey hairs that I do not shy away from hiding. I am not a native English speaker but I have fairly good comm. skills however perhaps not a match with a native speaker.	13	6

An example that immediately comes to mind is Figma Slides, where there are 2 modes, the canvas for ideation and the presentation mode for ... presentation.\n\nI have been seeing the patterns across frameworks and real life?, like HCD, Double Diamond, 'CODE' in Building a Second Brain or just the idea of hunting in general where there are two distinct phases, one of discovery and searching and the other of lazer focus.\n\nWith our traditional webapps and webpages etc, it is much more linear in fashion and helps with the second part of the process when we are drilling down into something, but limits the initial discovery portion. Or there are things like infinite whiteboards due to the expansive nature, they help out with research and discovery but doesnt really help when it comes time to focus.\n\nThis trend seems to also be occuring in cybersecurity? where e.g. wiz there are more visual representations being used to convey information, that is closer aligned to our way of thinking.\n\nIs this already a thing that exists? I would think it is a subset of UXD since optimizing for thinking still is in fact improving the UX but yea.	3	0

I have heard about Webflow to convert the Figma design into a full-fleged website, but I have not dabbled in learning Webflow just yet. I know that Webflow is a popular tool used to convert your design after creating it in Figma. I have experience coding in HTML/CSS and using Flask to create full-stack web applications. My question is: Is there another tool or plugin I should use if I want to convert my Figma design into straight code that I can serve through Flask? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, thanks!	3	3

I do anything from ux & ui to print design and social media, but I love product design and would like to focus on that more. As the title said, the company I work at has low UX maturity; we don't do any user research and my decisions are guided by the other team members (we're a small team of around 10), so I feel like I could be doing my job better and learning proper UX techniques (freshly graduated from a graphic design bachelor).\n\nI have been given a new assignment by the CEO to design an alternative version of our app that would target a different audience (medical instead of sport). This is a great opportunity for me to do some in-depth UX work for once and possibly a great piece for my portfolio, instead of just proposing the first design I come up with myself with no testing like I always do haha\n\nI want to take my time with this and do it properly, so my question to everyone here:  \n  \nHow can I convince my CEO to let me do proper user research (and where do I even source potential users myself??). Any tips in regards to this process? Thanks everyone!  \n	7	2

The brief only described the target audience and that it should be about saving money and including a gamification concept for teens between 12-18y. It should also have some teaching moments where the users can learn about saving money. \n\nThey gave me 3-4 hours to work on it and deliver no wireframes but only a visual, mostly finished concept. No more info, no existing screenflow, no content info... \n\nI failed miserably on the day itself. As i felt like i knew nothing anout the target group and needed to do some research into them, some existing banking apps for that target group and some games they like to play/socialmedia they interact with most. After that coming up with a visual concept left me with 1 hour to work on 3 screens, trying to decide what content to include where. Choosing a color concept, choosing icons/visual elements, trying a gamification concept etc... it looked shit, but they liked my research. They gave me until the end of the week (2 days) to finish the visual concept. Which i did... only for them to decline me as i took too much time... \n\nNow i'm wondering if i'm just very slow or if this was really just an unrealistic task timewise??\n\nWould be really interested in what you guys think.	6	1

We all are professional UX designers who work for professional institutions who embrace users, research, iterative design, validation, etc. \n\nBut none of us live in an ideal world. In fact, most of us live in a corporate world that couldn't care less about any of the above. \n\nI have very few actual case studies in my portfolio as I've worked for very few organizations that gave a shit about the aforementioned issues. \n\nSo, I guess my take is, a candidate having or not having extensive and detailed case studies isn't really an indicator to me as to how good they are, but rather what specific companies they have worked for. \n\nI feel the push for every UX designer having a plethora of detailed case studies is leading a lot of UX folks down a path that maybe isn't necessary. I'm also guessing it's leading to a lot of BS in a lot of case studies. :)\n\nI'd much rather see a nice presentation that focuses on problem solving. I don't need a full case study. Just tell me why that screen your showing has the features it has. If the answer is ""because sales really wanted it"" that's cool. That's a real world situation.

This could either mean that the team is fishing and doesn't have a clearly defined role, is being extremely picky or it is a fake role. It's hard for me to believe that a company has a req open for more than a month in this environment where there are talented designers - even those with directly transferable industry experience. If this is fake and intended to lure people in, it is unethical. Period. It's one thing to be an agency/company and mention that that the role is speculative and is for future consideration, so that people can know where they will end up, and quite another to claim they are hiring and yet not respond. \n\nSecond, there is an increasing amount of ghosting and mistreatment of candidates. Long winded processes, low rates, tests and companies simply not getting back to most candidates. Which again, leads me to think whether the role was just a pretense. People write detailed cover letters and are being asked to write, re-write their portfolios and come up with clear value propositions, only to be ghosted. It can really mess with one's confidence. \n\nWhy isn't there better UX and service design in the hiring process? If candidates are asked to ensure that their portfolios are scannable, concise and attractive, why isn't there a similar effort being invested into hiring? Is there no business objective tied to ensuring a good hiring experience? \n\nI have lots of questions, but hiring seems totally random and not meritocratic in this environment.

The plugin respects these scopes, applying tokens only to appropriate elements.\n   * Users can specify which properties (fills, strokes) should be considered for replacement via checkboxes.\n* **Processing Nodes**\n   * The plugin traverses all selected nodes, including those nested within frames and groups, ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n   * For each node, it determines the type (frame, shape, text) and checks if the fill, stroke, or effect colors match any tokens in the selected collection.\n* **Replacement with Tokens**\n   * If a match is found, the corresponding color in the node is replaced with the token, ensuring that the design stays consistent with the defined color system.\n\n[https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1396983967915872088/tokenify-replace-colors-with-tokens](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1396983967915872088/tokenify-replace-colors-with-tokens)\n\nI hope you enjoy it and find it helpful ;) Feel free to share your comments ü´°	0	3

So I invited one of my colleagues, Sam Cuevas, to share tips, resources, and insights on breaking into the gaming industry as a UX designer.¬†\n\nShe designed and contributed to games like Minecraft and Forza Motorsport 8, in addition to working on dozens of commercial websites and mobile apps.\n\nSam breaks down the core skills and essential software you need to learn, including the most popular ones in the industry.\n\nThis post is geared more towards beginners and aspiring UX designers who are interested in the gaming industry.\n\n(r/UXdesign mods, if this violates any rules, feel free to remove it. I added this guide because I think it‚Äôll be valuable for aspiring UX designers. Not trying to spam.)  \n  \nI encourage the folks with more experience to chime in and share their prespesctive and tips to help future UX designers work more effectively, I‚Äôd love to feature your insights.\n\nThis might give some hope to those trying to break into the gaming industry as UX designers.\n\n* Focus on demonstrating that you can already do the job that‚Äôs relevant to the context of the studio‚Äôs game through your portfolio.\n* Having a degree is less and less relevant each day especially in the current times. A solid portfolio without a degree trumps having a degree without a portfolio.\n   * Many game design/dev college programs require you to go through an internship in a studio as a graduation requirement, which means internships are just as (if not more) competitive than entry-level positions.\n* Use case studies, attention retention techniques, and context matching to help your portfolio stand out.\n   * Unlike game art, animation, or programming, where what you see is what you get. Use case studies to demonstrate your process, how you solve UX problems, and before/after results.\n   * Recruiters skim applications quickly. Use storytelling in your case studies to capture and retain recruiters‚Äô attention within the first 5-6 seconds.\n   * Studios heavily considers how contextual is your skills to their game. You‚Äôll have an advantage by identifying the games you want to work on and tailor your portfolio to them.\n* For game engines, familiarize yourself with the big two (Unreal and Unity) along with their scripting languages, and you'll cover most studios‚Äô technical requirements.\n   * Even for studios with proprietary engines, this will imply you can quickly adapt to their engine as needed, since they work on similar principles.\n   * You‚Äôre not a technical designer, so you don‚Äôt have to be very proficient.\n* For visual and graphic design software, Figma is the best bet since it‚Äôs becoming an industry standard, and it's easier to learn than Photoshop or Illustrator.\n   * For example, the Candy Crush and Minecraft team (Sam worked for) uses Figma.\n* Layer a strong understanding of design principles and how players experience the entire gameplay, since UX designer touches almost every part of the game.\n   * This will also position you for a possible creative director role down the line.\n* Here are some job application tips that you might already know, but I‚Äôll share them just in case.\n   * Don‚Äôt worry about having 100% of the job requirements. If you hit 50% of the requirements, apply. You‚Äôll learn as you go.\n   * If you're less experienced, look for larger studios that will offer training, as smaller studios require you to hit the ground running because of their limited resources.\n   * If you find a studio you want to work with but don't see a UX position available, apply anyway for a play tester position.

I have an interview coming up where I have to present my portfolio. The company provided a guide on tips and how to prep. Reading through, it states they value interactivity and discussion. What are some good ways to touch on this? Initial thoughts are showing videos/gifs demonstrating the UI. Maybe pull up a clickable prototype?\n\nAlso, it says in the guide that the presentation will be recorded. I'll be asking the recruiter before what they plan to do with the recording. Any insights here? Is this the new standard? Maybe I should ask them to sign an NDA to protect myself?\n\nThank you!	11	1

So your job is more about making good looking designs that kinda work, as opposed to anything else. \n\nClients rarely listen to a designers perspective, and are generally happier if you produce exactly what they ask you even if its not something that makes UX sense. \n\nLinkedIn and other platforms are full of guru's regurgitating content, producing little in the way of real value but fattening up their wallets by being able to sell to the UX designers fears and perceived shortcomings. \n\nThose who actually know what they heck they are doing are too busy ensuring their jobs remain secure by working hard, and they don't really post their experience online. \n\nYeah this rant doesnt have much value. I guess what I am trying to say is, i've found it much more valuable for me to be someone who can create good visuals while listening to the client, doing exactly what they say, and not really providing much creative output. It keeps my work flowing in steadily and the clients happy. Also the moment I start following UX Guru's advice I find myself second guessing my every decision and thinking of myself as a generally bad UX designer lacking knowledge in every department.  \n\nAlso none of the flairs apply to my post so I'm just picking one that makes the most sense.	83	186

There are also multiple cohorts of patients for each flow.\n\nEnrollment, sample collection, and health results data that is collected from these flows are also used in other projects that designers at my company have been able to lead to help healthcare organizations with patient care.\n\nFor each case study: \n- How have you‚Äôve shown how 1 project fits into the larger context of a longer user journey without going overboard?\n\n- Have you been able to show multiple iterations of a project in a concise way (pre and post-launch)?\n\n- Is there a way I could nod to how the data collected from my flows also help power other projects at the company?	3	9

Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD, which helps explain why the expectations of these UX roles (meetings, client calls, unclear expectations) caused me to end up where I am.\n\nAs much as I love so much of UX, I'm struggling to see how I can carry on in this line of work. UX Writing was definitely a better fit than Product Design, but I just don't see many job postings for that role anymore. Unfortunately, I cannot survive without an income, so I'm feeling a bit lost at the moment. \n\nIf there are any other autistic designers, I'd love any advice on what's worked for you.

I'm curious what this community's take on documenting design decisions made over the course of the work they do.\n\nMy take is it's critical and there's no great tooling out there currently to help manage it (perhaps the reigns could be taken up by Figma someday). Often, designers I've talked to about this view this as unnecessary work until the point they get asked a question about why a certain decision was made. Typically, I've seen this happen up to a year or more later. Often, the designer forgets the original intention; other times the original designer may not be with the organization or team anymore.\n\nIn the past, I've urged teams I work with to include this in any ticketing system such as Jira to go along with any prototypes/mockups that are included for the work to be done. Focus usually has been on critical or particularly controversial decisions.\n\nSo I'm curious what approaches have others used if anything at all?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1ecvmat)	2	1

As a hiring manager, I'm attempting to gauge not just skill fit, but the ability to build remote relationships. For the sake of this post, it boils down how you present yourself; the optics of it all.\n\n1. get a good camera. if you want to work remote, make sure you have a good camera so people can see you.\n2. be sure you have good lighting. dont sit in a dark room, dont get too lost in the shadows. light it up.\n3. have a good mic. or at least check your sensitivity. if we can't hear you, its going to impact the session.\n4. be prepared to share your work. i've already seen the high-level portfolio website, and if it isnt in depth, be prepared to dive deeper.\n5. dont apply to jobs you arent qualified for. you wont get it, the market is competitive.\n6. be clear with your ownership. ive encountered so many people speaking at a high level about the project, glossing over their ownership. i need to know what you did.\n7. prepare to talk results (STAR). every case study, every story you share should have some sort of impact to your team, the org, the business, etc. the amount of people that waffle on this is a bummer.\n8. have a test run with a friend to make sure your equipment works, camera is sharp, mic sounds good, etc. dont have a dry run in your interview!\n\nBest of luck out there!	12	43

I've created multiple brandings from scratch, executive summaries, fairly complex animations, pitch decks, social media posts, design systems, all whilst designing websites and I'm worried this makes me seem ""unwanted"" due to the lack of specialisation.\n\nI've also been taking on some freelance work on Webflow projects. What initially was a favour for a friend, became an occasional side gig. It's nice to have some additional income, but it's the exact same situation as again, I'm completely self taught from this too.\n\nIf I got into a room with a recruiter, I genuinely wouldn't know how to even talk about my work as I feel I lack that knowledge. Hell, I don't even know what I'd put under my responsibilities without it sounding like I'm completely exaggerating."	49	59

I've been noticing some broader trends in the UX specific agency space.   \n  \nFor example, I have one hypothesis that design Ops and strategy are higher value offerings and clients are willing to pay a higher rate for that sort of work.

It's taking them a few days to get back to me, so now I'm overthinking everything and super anxious. This is my first time through the interview funnel in a few years so in hindsight I know there was a lot of room for improvement. The thing that's eating at me is that I know without a doubt I'm qualified for the job, I just psyched myself out in the interview! The only thing that makes me feel better is continuing to reach out to recruiters and keeping things pushing.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from this experience is to take the time to be thoughtful with my responses and stay authentic. The second I started giving canned, reactionary answers bc I was so nervous, everyone in the room could tell. I was successful in the early stages because I was collected and deliberate but vulnerable.  \n\nHow are y'all doing?	50	50

Now, they want us to run as many a/b tests as possible because 'we need to work data-driven '(read: to justify the software investment). We tried to push this back with reason (basically every argument you could think of - you need a clear design hypothesis, the outcome needs to justify the time and effort, the user problem needs to be big enough, there is no need to test every single website change, etc. ) but to no avail. We are just expected to 'test' every change we make - without being able to spend extra time on it. To make it worse, any colleague (customer service, marketing etc.) can bring in their own test ideas which we are expected to help set up (with designs and copywriting). We do not have the expertise in-house to set up tests correctly - the person currently doing it, a CRO, is not qualified to do so. I am not against having this tool in the toolbox - I want to use it where it is relevant. We proposed that we need extra time planned for this - let's do a pilot and see what happens - a designer needs to triage every test request - etc. But everything we say is seen as being ' unsupportive' since we are not already testing. What else can we do to handle this issue? Like I said, there's really no reasoning possible and we're stuck. The most recent 'solution' from the management side I heard of is that they will hire a designer and place them outside the UX design team, which will solely work on a/b testing. Which will be a disaster. I'd appreciate any ideas.	30	18

I initially suggested to developers to use skeleton loaders for better performance and overall UX, and they did implement it. Unfortunately, though, after the implementation our performance marketing team has highlighted that due to a tech limitation our current use of skeleton loaders is causing poor CLS score. This of course negatively impacts our SEO rankings and everyone freaked out.   \n  \nTo address this, they are proposing a fixed layout approach where elements are left blank if they aren't needed, to avoid layout shifts. We've been asked to design a PDP with all the possible complications. When some of those elements are not there, they will just be left blank.  \nFor example, if a product has the possibility to be paid with Klarna, we'll provide a template where a line that says ""Pay this with Klarna"" is there, but if for a product this possibility is not available, then the user will see just a blank line, a white space.   \n  \nI fear that this solution might look not only visually unappealing but also potentially confuse users...   \nDo you have any suggestion or literature on this? With data on their hands, I can't really do anything to push back this decision."	2	1

Like many other companies out there, they have no idea what their UX designer should do nor is there an actual process or guidelines for deliverables. \n\nThey basically order something randomly in the middle of the week and expect it to be done on top of the other stuff. I‚Äôm the only designer in product design btw. \n\nThere‚Äôs no user stories, no assigned tasks in Jira, nothing. I‚Äôm supposed to ‚Äúself manage‚Äù. \n\nHowever, they‚Äôre very conscientious of these problems and are very open to new solutions in their work flow. In fact they‚Äôre constantly asking me if I‚Äôm okay with how things are being handled. \n\nSo here‚Äôs my question: how should I begin organizing the design side including communication with product managers and developers? How do I establish a set of game rules that will make our job easier?\n\n	8	11

I found a lot on mockupworld that I really liked, but they're pretty much all PSD files, and I don't have Photoshop. I looked around at a couple of the Figma plugin ones, and a few other sites, but the quantity and quality of the free mockups seems to be lacking. (Or maybe i'm just being picky.) I'm wondering if I should bite the bullet and buy the Adobe creative suite (student plan for $20.00 a month) or just go with the selection I have from the free Figma plugins/other sites.\n\nMy only concern with the Adobe route is the whole terms of service issue that they had going on recently that a lot of people were angry about.

Product functionality: how do you present the functionality of the product, all features and how they should work?\n\nThe struggle I have is to move my abstract deliverables into something that UI designer can work with and not lose a lot of time and get frustrated about what has to be built and what exactly have to be there. \n\nI appreciate you very much! \n\n\n\n	13	3

Headers are all slightly different, type has no rules, spacing is all over the place but there is a decent amount to the app. On top of that the company just went through a brand update. The marketing site is getting a fresh look and feel that will widen the gap between what someone else‚Äôs on the web vs when they download the app. \n\nMy question is how do I go about refreshing the whole app to make it align with the new brand refresh? My thoughts are:\n\n1. Audit the existing app\n2. Identify key components\n3. Bring in brand guide and create style guide\n4. ???\n\nI could either redesign every single component at once (I think that‚Äôs the wrong way to go and no one would agree to do that), grandfather in new design where all new designs take on the newer branding, or focus on adjusting atomic level elements first like grid, type, colour. My main concern is it will look bad when new components live on old screens. The brand refresh keeps fonts the same, colours similar, and the app currently already looks like a mixed bag of inconsistency.\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes with all this design debt and a new brand I could apply?	3	5

I come from a marketing background before I moved into digital products.\n\nAs such, I see a lot of UX design as the desire to solve communication problems (software in general solves communication problems either between software or between people).\n\nWhat I have come to dislike a little bit about the process of UX design (as I experienced and learned it) is that it rarely optimizes for user growth or is inherently interesting. I think a reason for that is that most UX designers work under product managers, and reach is rarely earned by the product itself but by ads paid with money.\n\nYou can see the opposite in Game Design, where a lot of games have some sort of killer or iconic mechanic that draws the user base to it. A game needs to offer a unique idea from the very start. I'm unsure why this is not the case in most UX concepts and realizations I see.\n\nThe reason could be that many UX designers never had to learn (or are empowered) to make something ""interesting"" but optimize first and foremost for forming a habit (which is a super valid strategy).\n\nFrom my perspective, Product Development often feels like, ""We will build the product 'right' and then we use branding and advertising to get the users to use it.""\n\nI'm currently trying to understand if there's a framework to build ""virality"" directly into the product by focusing on specific delighters that actually might not be important for the overall UX but help to get users in the first place.\n\nThe underlying thesis I have with this is that with the ability to build new products faster with AI, software will move more into the meme space instead of being only about usability. A recent example I can think of was the lip-sync in Musical.ly.\n\nI also built an app a few years ago that let you scan election posters for all the important information about the politicians on them. The scanning was completely useless UX-wise (after the first use) but was the feature that got people to try out the app.\n\nDo you know of other examples, and can you maybe point me towards a framework that specifically focuses on that?"	13	4

I without hesitation ended up sending it in the e-mail.\n\nShould I have not sent it out? \n\nEdit: Thank you so much for giving me great advice. This was really helpful. \n\nSince there are so many gaps in my post, I thought I‚Äôd address them. \n\n1. This is the first time ever I‚Äôm interviewing for a role, my past roles were word of mouth references for roles or direct invites. So I‚Äôm not very sure what the norm is. \n\n2. I‚Äôve interviewed a couple of times before this one but they never asked me for the Figma files. Just the prototype link to show their team. \n\n3. The task was to redesign their own product‚Äôs onboarding experience and find two other things I‚Äôd prioritize to change about their app. \n\n4. While I did cooperate, my designs in the past have been stolen and used in the name of interviews. I just hope they (this company) don‚Äôt do it. \n\n5. Also, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the layers. I‚Äôm from India and on my previous job I did do a lot of hiring for junior roles and when I was leaving I was interviewing candidates to replace me. A lot of them ACTUALLY copied and pasted online solutions that were already available OR got someone else to do their assignment. So, I‚Äôd imagine they wanted to see the version history of how the solution evolved and who else has worked on the file. Like for a 1 week design assignment, I doubt file organization would matter so much given the company just has a product owner and no UX designers onboard yet. \n\n6. The previous point now brings to mind this question - Do hiring managers look at the version history of the file like I do? Do you check to see if others have worked on it or was it solely worked on by the candidate? \n\nThank you so much again! You guys are the best ‚ù§Ô∏è	84	46

It's my first time working with PMs, engs, etc. I'm mostly tasked with smaller work like comp analysis, testing, minor design explorations while the senior tackles bigger tasks.\n\nI did two design hand offs and feedback was great. I've completed everything on time if not sooner. But what I wonder when I will receive larger responsibilities? That leads to my next question...\n\nWhat tasks are typically delegated to juniors? Has anyone felt a tough transition and a hit in confidence? I overlooked a design decision on one thing (it's now in QA after hand off) and it will now change.\n\nI often hear about imposter syndrome a lot. How do I know if I have it? I sometimes lack confidence but not sure if this is a product of imposter syndrome or my lack of experience? How does someone overcome this?\n\nI work with a senior designer who is mentoring me but I'm only tasked with small design tweaks. He takes on larger responsibilities and im not involved in jamming possible solutions. Maybe because ive subtly shown im not ready yet? How do I show more promise? In some ways I feel like im overthinking but I also fear of being shit at a job so I've always worked hard to not be in that position.

I often come across outstanding portfolios on platforms like Dribbble, where the call to action usually leads to a contact form. The experience isn't much different when visiting an agency's own website.\n\nHere's a typical scenario:\n1. **Contact Form**: I fill out detailed forms, providing information about my brand, budget, project scope, and vision.\n2. **Follow-Up**: I receive a request to schedule a call and often complete a survey to further explain my needs. This is typically framed as a way to tailor their services to my specific requirements.\n3. **Scheduled Call**: ‚Ä¶.. days later‚Ä¶.. We have a call that lasts anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes, discussing my project in more detail.\n4. **Waiting for Proposal**: After the call, I wait several days to receive a proposal that outlines their offerings and costs.\n\nMy concern is this: these professionals are supposed to excel at creating exceptional user experiences, yet the process they use to engage potential clients feels disjointed and inefficient. If I, as a prospective client, have to wait days just to learn if their services fit my needs, it hardly seems like a seamless experience.\n\nI'm not here to criticize harshly, but to seek understanding. Why is this the norm in an industry dedicated to optimizing user interactions? Shouldn't the client onboarding experience reflect the same level of UX excellence?\n\nI'm hoping to learn if anyone out there is approaching this differently and more effectively. I‚Äôd be really interested in checking them out and following their work. \n\nLooking forward to your thoughts.	9	1

I‚Äôm having major anxiety about my career. \n\nI worked 16 years as a freelancer and the last seven for a company in their marketing department. I‚Äôve done good work, but have always struggled with imposter syndrome. My current job doesn‚Äôt allow me to do much design and the coding is handled by a much more talented developer so my design and coding skills have atrophied. I also don‚Äôt really enjoy working on marketing websites anymore and am tired of learning the latest coding technologies. \n\nFor a while I‚Äôve thought I would like to transition into UX design. I like the problem-solving aspect of it. I‚Äôve done a short bootcamp that was OK and I occasionally get something a little more UX-related in my current job like the ROI calculator I recently designed. I am also connected to a UX designer through my company‚Äôs mentorship program.\n\nJust recently, I started having major anxiety about the whole situation. I‚Äôm really starting to despise my current job. I spend so much time copying and pasting blogs and doing other mundane stuff. There are also some days where there just isn‚Äôt much to do.\n\nThen I worry that I am too old and feel overwhelmed with trying to figure out how to move into UX. \n\nCan anyone offer any encouragement or perspective?\n\n\n	6	10

After 5 years working in digital Product Design in healthcare, I decided to leave my job with nothing else lined up. I had several reasons for leaving such as a toxic work environment, bad work-life balance, and after introspection, realizing I don‚Äôt enjoy designing for healthcare.\n\nSafe to say, I underestimated this job market and it‚Äôs been difficult to get interviews.\n\nRecently, I was given an offer to work for a company in finance technology. However, they‚Äôre offering me a salary that is $40K LESS than what I was previously making. It‚Äôs still a six-figure offer, but because I live in a metropolitan area in California, my cost of living is very high. Their offer is also $20K less than the average salary for people of my experience (based on Salary reporting websites).\n\nDespite this pay cut, this is an opportunity to design in a new industry, based on my interviews and the company reviews it seems there‚Äôs good work-life balance, it‚Äôs fully remote, they have a comprehensive benefits package, and the hiring manager and my PM counterparts seem like great people.\n\nI‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has taken a significant pay cut due to the economy? And if so, what were your reasons? If you decided to decline an offer with a significant pay cut, what were your reasons?\n\nEDIT: I ended up taking the offer! I appreciate everyone's insights and thoughts.	63	70

I have 25 YOE, so I should have examples but I draw a blank. So I'm trying to compile a list of these types of questions that come up, so that I can spend some time thinking and come up with examples ahead of time. Here's my list so far: \n\n1. Tell me about a time you had to solve a complex (or ambiguous) problem.\n2. Describe a time you had to make an important decision with limited information and time.\n3. Tell me about a time your initial approach didnt work. How did you pivot?\n4. Tell me about a time you had a conflict or disagreement with a coworker. How did you handle it?\n5. Tell me about a process improvement you implemented.\n6. Tell me about a time you had to champion something and win people over to your side.\n7. Tell me about a time you had a big influence on product strategy or vision.\n\nWould love to add to this list - what am I missing? How do you handle these when you can't think of an example?	34	44

There is no relation to F1 in the project, so the overlap wouldn‚Äôt be noticeable by most, if at all.\nI‚Äôm not quite sure if this is considered a bad practice or if anyone has had problems doing something like this?

This can easily be done by presenting a stack of sliders or incremental +/- components.      \n  \nThe only wrinkle is the definition of one attribute can affect the available range of another attribute.  Say you max out Slider A which means you only can have 75% of Slider B.\n\nThis could be done by dynamically graying out/shortening the last 25% of Slider B upon the definition of Slider A but im curious if there are examples that come to mind for folks.  \n\nExtra bonus karma if you can think of a mobile example :) \n\nThanks!!!!	2	1

Essentially I am in a permanent state of learning whether it be on project or through courses. \n\nLately, I have been wondering if learning front-end development to the point where you can actually contribute in a fast paced environment alongside full-stack engineers is even possible.  Everyone says designers that can code are more valuable and that these skills will improve your ability to design solutions. I know a few devs that have turned UX, but not any designers that have turned dev. I have done some basic html and css courses in the past. \n\nAlso JavaScript is where a lose all focused never mind frameworks like react or angular. \n\nCurious to know what other people‚Äôs experiences have been? Any designers that have actually picked up some real coding skills that would like to share how they went about it.\n\n\n\n	125	132

He asked what about how should we confirm the deletion. (Not how we confirm the intention - we have a pattern for that and it is a pretty common confirmation popup dialog) How does the system confirm to the user that the action has gone thru. \n\nI was arguing that the fact that the content from the fields or the file in question being no longer present is *enough* of a confirmation of that distructive action taking place. He was proposing a green success toast message with a ""Deletetion successful"" type message - and the team agrees that this (out of 3 types of visual confirmations) is the way.\n\nIs it something that I am missing here? Because I still feel that less is more in this case. Why bother with an extra message?"	43	4

And I (and potentially others) would also be interested in how easy, hard, informational you've found things you've used. \n\nHere's a few I've amassed or uncovered a few over the years. In general these are US-based:\n\n\n\n# UX Training or General Training\n\n[**LinkedIn Learning**](https://www.linkedin.com/premium/products/?trk=trk_default_learning&upsellOrderOrigin=learning_member_upsell&utype=learning&upsellTrk=lil_upsell_defensibility-hero_subscription&upsellTrackingId=XuAY9FOvRTuFnOEy8suHJw%3D%3D&destRedirectURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Flearning%2F%3Fsrc%3Dgo-pa%26trk%3Dsem-ga_campid%2E20913166733_asid%2E159042219324_crid%2E702112495436_kw%2Elinkedin%2520learning%2520enterprise_d%2Ec_tid%2Ekwd-322594029763_n%2Eg_mt%2Ee_geo%2E9198901%26mcid%3D7148407339128156170%26cid%3D%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw1920BhA3EiwAJT3lSQUlcVDly5CluD_BNYn4u0LBieKDUCqQmRPZNySJFvO9THQ_J1sY0RoC5SIQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw%2Eds%26trk%3Dtrk_default_learning&_l=en_US) **(Free Month-$20 a month value)**\n\nLinkedIn offers a free month every year or so as a trial.\n\n  \n**LinkedIn Learning - Library-Assisted (Totally Free, Ongoing Value)**\n\nCheck with your county or city library system. In many cases, your library system has virtual 'seats' for library card holders to use to access LinkedIn Learning (mine has 45 or so seats, and never have been blocked.) Call them and ask about it. They love helping people find new programs. It's likely a 4 letter code that identifies your library system that you need (and better yet a bookmarkable link.)\n\nYou can also link your current LIL account. You'll just need to start on that login page specified for your county.\n\n\n\n**WIOA or Workforce Investment Act ($2000-5000, one time per layoff)**\n\nYou can use this to build your skills, or jump to a new career. This is a program created by the Clinton administration in 1998. It's a federal program from the US Department of Labor, but fulfilled at the state level. You do need to be accepting unemployment for this program, however it's not affiliated with unemployment. You can look up your state 'workforce' group. The wording can vary by state, but here's a place to start:\n\n[https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/AmericanJobCenters/find-american-job-centers.aspx](https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/AmericanJobCenters/find-american-job-centers.aspx)\n\nYou might find they will push a state program or classes. Mine did, but I didn't push back because I felt I was pushing it. They also may offer resume or interview classes. Simply say no, if you aren't interested.\n\n*I was able to get a Scrum Master Certification (2 days), Product Owner Certification (3 days) and do PMP Project Management (5 days) training‚Äîabout $3500 worth of classes. I had to do a good amount of paperwork and it varies by group how much and what sort of classes you can get.* \n\n*\*\*\*A friend of mine in another county near me who is a developer got $5000 worth of Nielsen Norman Group UX training via the program even though it was out-of-state. \*\*\**\n\n\n\n# General Help\n\nThis site [https://www.benefits.gov/](https://www.benefits.gov/) was passed onto me by a friend who purposefully stays at the poverty level and caps himself at $12k a year. Most of these are income-based, so you can have stock, assets, etc but if you aren't making good money‚Äìyou can apply and see what happens. And I'm not sure how the lookback period is‚Äîbut I was reviewed 3-5 months of past income/work. \n\nThis is not tied to unemployment benefits, but they do want to know if you are or aren't on that program. And you may be eligible for more programs too. In the earlier part of the year, there was available monies for power/energy. My friend who has a farm received $3000. And that program starts in the fall after Congress refunds it (annually). There's also an internet subsidized program that works similarly.\n\n\n\n**SNAP/EBT/Food Stamps ($300 a month)**\n\n[https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/361](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/361)\n\n[https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory)\n\nThis can vary state-to-state. I'd applied, gotten a call by a case worker, was asked about my last freelance project and gave my total for income this year. It's well under the poverty level so far. It is not affected by your assets.  It's very low for me and at the moment $0. \n\nI had to mail in a form and 2-3 days later I received my temporary card loaded with June ($250)  and a few days later got July ($291) added. There can also be cash benefits as well, so apply and see. I did not get this, but don't recall why. I think it was last year's tax returns. Im not sure how long SNAP benefits last. You also may need to reapply if there's an automatic cutoff.\n\n\n\n**Medical Assistance ($400 a month up to unlimited $?)**\n\nLook up your state, and find the 'State Care' program your state offers.\n\n[https://www.benefits.gov/categories/Healthcare%20and%20Medical%20Assistance](https://www.benefits.gov/categories/Healthcare%20and%20Medical%20Assistance)\n\nThis is coverage for health insurance, prescriptions, eye care, dental care, and may vary by your state and your income. Again this is not affected by your assets.  I was told I will have Medical Assistance that will cover all my copays, premiums, and any procedure I have‚Äîas well as any of my outstanding medical bills. I also applied right at the end of June, and cancelled my personal policy. I'll be getting refunded two months of premiums as well.  \n\nIn my state, first you're put on Medical Assistance for two months as a temporary way to get immediate help. Then I selected a provider (like Blue Cross) but with Medical Assistance paying for everything. Then I get a provider policy, and anything that is not covered by their health, eye, and dental coverage will be paid by the state/Medical Assistance. \n\n\n\n***What programs have you found helpful?*** \n\n***In general, I had a stigma about doing any of these, as well as using my savings. But these programs are made exactly for situations like ours. And do consider some of these resources may be cut depending on the fall election.*** \n\n***Also going to a physical office for EBT is sobering as well.*** \n\n***Please share your details if you are comfortable or just direct people to any resources. Also, DM with any questions and I'll try to help.*** \n\n***Additionally, if you know someone who needs help please pass this along.***\n\n\n\n	6	7

I'm about to start applying for a new job and was updating my portfolio. Currently, there are 3 projects. The first one is based on a real problem faced by users of an app, and the second one is kind of an enhancement innovation project where there is no actual existing problem to solve but rather it aims to improve the UX by adding more layers of personalization, and the third one is a design system case study. I wanted to keep all my projects different to show an extended range. How does it look if I add a service design project to my portfolio next? Or is it better if I stick to a strictly UX problem project? I do not intend on having more than 4 projects. Feedback is greatly appreciated.	4	3

It‚Äôs starting to feel not worth it, so I‚Äôm exploring other options. \n\nHere‚Äôs my idea. What if I have my Wix site with the typical pages - Home, Projects, About, Contact. And on the Projects page, I have my typical project cards BUT instead of those cards linking to a project page within my site, they link out to a Figma Slides deck for that project? Each project would have its own unique slide deck linked from the project card on my site.\n\nI‚Äôm wondering what recruiters and design managers will think of this format. Does it seem too atypical or unprofessional at all?? I‚Äôm worried that especially in this horrible job market that something a bit different like this might turn off the recruiter, instead of having a more normal site with all the projects there. It‚Äôs just insane that making a portfolio project in Wix could take me weeks whereas making it in Figma might take me a day. \n\nAny recruiters or hiring managers here?

I started as a web/front-end designer, and for the last 9 years, I've worked as a UX/UI designer in various roles. For the past 4 years, I've been a Senior Product Designer at a small design agency. However, I've felt burned out for the last year and a half, with no opportunities to grow. I've been stuck in projects where the most challenging aspect is modifying existing UI, focusing more on design cosmetics than solving core problems.

I'm not exactly sure where to start, and I'd really appreciate your advice on how to proceed and where I can go to learn more.\n\nTo give you some context, I'm a UI designer transitioning into a UX role. A few months ago, I joined the design team at an e-commerce development company. The company has never properly implemented UX design in their development process. The design team originally consisted of four people, three of whom were considered ""senior designers"" due to their years of experience (7+ years), but I would classify them as mid-level at best, with no UX experience. Two of these designers quit a month before I joined, and one was fired. Only a junior UX/UI designer remained.\n\nWe also have a pseudo UX manager who is part of the company's performance team, focusing on very basic tasks for clients with little to no e-commerce experience. He communicates well, which led some high-level executives to give him this role. As a result, I am the unofficial manager of the team. The junior UX/UI designer lacks management experience and is just starting in UX.\n\nWe have another team member who completed a Google professional certificate in UX, the same one I started but haven't finished. However, she has no other design experience and barely knows how to use Figma.\n\nEven though I haven't finished my UX training, I am passionate about this field and want to become a top-notch professional in user experience. Sometimes, I think about quitting this job and finding a place where I can learn from more experienced people. On the other hand, I believe this is a fantastic opportunity to organize an entire sector, as I am being given the freedom to do so.\n\nHow would you approach the situation of evolving a company with low UX maturity? Where should I start, and where can I go to learn more? How can I demonstrate that the current practices are harmful (we're losing clients left and right) and that investing more in UX can help with this? Your insights would be greatly appreciated."	7	12

To be clear, i have not done this primarily for monetary reasons as i genuinely care about the company i work for. But, this seems like a ridiculously low bonus for such a large contract, especially for something that is so far out of my scope of work and the fact that i have invested months into this.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience in a similar situation? I know every industry/position but from what i could find, usually it's closer to 2-10% rather than a fixed bonus. Also, my CEO is not the easiest person to negotiate with and i am not a confrontational person."	22	5

Can anyone recommend resources?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1e47klo/having_trouble_getting_momentum_on_revamping_my/	Hello all! I've been unemployed for some time (layoff followed by long Covid) and I'm rehashing all my application materials in preparation for a long job hunt. I've got my resume nicely updated and I'm working on STAR stories in preparation for interviews. However, I'm feeling pretty stuck with my portfolio. I know it's the most important part of my job hunt and therefore it's the most daunting. My career so far has straddled UXR and UXD at a B2B hardware company, so this is my first time making a website and dealing with UI in any capacity. I'm struggling with how to frame my work, how much detail to include, and of course the design of the site itself. Given that I was in the R&D department, it's tricky to quantify impact since the work we did was so early in the pipeline. I can link multiple publications and patents for each project, but I can't throw out numbers/metrics or point to product on the market. \n\nMy struggle is partly a skill issue (storytelling is lacking and my visual design is... not strong, lol) and partly the remaining dregs of what used to be debilitating imposter syndrome. I've got a first draft of the site and a general idea of the skills and personality traits I want to convey, but I don't know what to do next. Is there some kind of 'UXD Portfolio for Dummies' resource out there? Have other people gotten stuck here or am I a unique weirdo? And if so, how did you get un-stuck? Help!	8	5

They had nothing, no resource whatsoever. They only provided the type or name of items that they sell and name of the company. When i asked what is their brand values and identity they had no idea. So i had to create a bunch of logos with different style (around 20 logos) and finalize the brand identity with trial and error method. And then when time came for website designing, they will just show me few website to refer from. They dont even have images of the service/product that they sell. I had to find images/videos and even the partner company logos. That they would keep on insisting to find better image and videos. I did heard somewhere before that ux designer has to decide what images and videos should be placed on the website. But when it comes to product. I have to research on what the product is and make sure the images are correct. Is this normal or should I be asking the clients to provide the resources. If its 10 or 20 images i can handle it, but when thy ask me for about 200+products i get really frustrated.	2	1

Top-level comments that do not include requests for feedback may be removed. When asking for feedback, please be as detailed as possible by 1) providing context, 2) being specific about what you want feedback on, and 3) stating what kind of feedback you are NOT looking for:\n\n***Example 1***\n\n&gt;**Context:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I‚Äôm 4 years into my career as a UX designer, and I‚Äôm hoping to level up to senior in the next 6 months either through a promotion or by getting a new job.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Looking for feedback on:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Does the research I provide demonstrate enough depth and my design thinking as well as it should?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**NOT looking for feedback on:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Aesthetic choices like colors or font choices.\n\n***Example 2***\n\n&gt;**Context:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I‚Äôve been trying to take more of a leadership role in my projects over the past year, so I‚Äôm hoping that my projects reflect that.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Looking for feedback on:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This case study is about how I worked with a new engineering team to build a CRM from scratch.

QUESTION TIME:\n\nThe brand I'm working on has a color palette of 5 colors and is primarily used for email and direct mail (we're not building websites)... without giving it away one is a primary color and the rest are white to dark grey and the entire current design template for email templates is designed off that... the entire thing ‚Äì¬†buttons, modules, text... it's basic, dated.. built for outlook basically.\n\nEverything I'm seeing online has these massive color palettes of grey-900 to grey-50 with with 8-12 shades in between... do I **NEED** to do that? Like, I know it doesn't look good? But in theory could I just have my brand-500 and then neutrals vaguely spaced out accordingly? incase one day they decide to not be so outdated?\n\nDark mode is going to be a whole other nightmare... I'm **trying** to do this the ""*right""* way... with extremely limited time and resources and probably the wrong tools... so any advice would be so amazing.\n\nThanks in advance!"	11	3

I'm finding myself torn between liking them and also wanting just a little bit more. Many of these websites also appear to be portfolios of fairly senior designers. \n\nI know my question may seem a bit broad because of the sheer number of websites on display, but I've noticed they all have a lot in common in terms of visual and UI design. \n\nWould you guys endorse this style of website for hosting a UX portfolio? Why or why not? If not, would you recommend it for any other kind of website?	5	25

I will start at the new place in two weeks. I can say that I had a pretty rough experience over the past 1.5 years. Luckily, I wasn't affected by the massive layoffs in our industry, but my safety net was running out, so I pretty much jumped ship at the last second. Overall, after 1.5 years and over 200 applications, I got about seven interviews and two offers.\n\nI feel very frustrated with the current state of our field. For reference, after my interviews, I found out that some of my seniors, who have over ten years of experience over me, had applied for the same jobs. I was literally competing with the people who taught me UX in the first place, which is crazy. I cannot stay calm, not to mention the absurd number of people diluting our UX industry. It feels like our numbers doubled during the pandemic, and many come from bootcamps. I remember some interactions with colleagues who didn't even know the basics, like using a grid system in Figma for their design or using various resources and plugins to ease their work. Don't even get me started on gathering data or using auto-layout in Figma; that thing is like alien technology to them, which is very, very sad. Why do I have to compete with people like this? I know I sound very irritating and maybe straight-up ignorant, but you have to empathize with my absurd journey.\n\nA few pieces of advice I can give are to stay away from ""Easy Apply"" on LinkedIn; it is not worth it. Most interactions I had were with companies that made me register and apply using long forms on their websites, which pretty much vets out tons of newbies or people who don't have the patience. More than ever, UI skills are secondary. Most people look for pure UX or/and BA skills. Can you hold your own presenting stuff in front of stakeholders? Furthermore, for online portfolios, don't just show pretty screens. People really start looking for the nitty-gritty details like how you came to this conclusion and how you collected the data (more than before, at least).\n\nCompanies have become very selective with candidates and stingy with salaries. [Gone are the days like this](https://x.com/i/status/1584731550658068480). Personally, I will make an effort to either start my own thing in the near future or shift to something more stable. I don't want to spook anyone, but I find that this field fluctuates way too much."	38	104

Each one of those actions would open a modal / new screen with two input fields, a text box, a file upload button and a button for applying/saving/deleting the info. The system is a internal SaaS thing and the users are used to very messy modals with a lot of content.\n\nMy main arguments for the modals would be 1) to keep the users in the same ""context"" (as the info edited is related to the main screen) ; 2) this would render 2 screens less, maybe would feel  a bit quicker.\n\nWoild you consider  this a bad practice?

However, the qualifications and responsibilities seemed more aligned with those of an entry-level designer. The job description didn‚Äôt mention any collaboration with other designers. Upon further research, I found that the company currently doesn‚Äôt employ any designers. After reaching out to a current employee, my suspicion was confirmed: they are looking for someone to be the sole designer, handling multiple projects and products independently.\n\nGiven this context, I am wondering whether this role should actually be targeted towards a senior designer, rather than a mid-level one? It seems like a significant workload for a single person, especially since the qualifications appear quite ‚Äúbeginner-friendly.‚Äù While it might be manageable with a team of designers, I feel that this environment might be a rough for one person. \n\nI am a recent grad searching for entry-level positions.

UXDesign	2024-07-12 15:46:02	1	pimeme		Senior careers		Horror story: Marketing kept interfering	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1e1kw5m/horror_story_marketing_kept_interfering/	In my previous workplace the head of brand and marketing for a significant portion of my tenure controlled the design outcomes. Any effort with pushback was futile as he was the founding member and would say that the order have came from one of the founder.\n\nPMs give me a deadline, I design the feature, the marketing guy tells that the PM is not allowed to see the outcome unless it approved by him. And I kept missing deadline due to him to the point that the org started planning to layoff me. I was shocked to find about it that how they can even consider it when I am going and beyond and working in the weekends too.\n\nThe problem was that the guy couldn't design. He used to tell often that he had a UX auditor kind of role previously with design thinking kind of org. But the guy literally never had or never can produce anything himself. Once he called a meeting along a content writer because he wanted the product copy to be written according to the tone he have set. My job was to give context of the few dozen screens so the content writer and him can do the UX copy exercise. What happened is that he opened chatgpt and kept on prompting about the copy. 70 minutes had passed and and we were over 3 screens only and finally had it. Told them to get the context and do the chatgpt exercise for as long as they want. I started giving them the context but seeing that they are not asking clarifying questions gave me a good idea that they are totally ignoring and doesn't want to work in this way. The next day he setup a meeting with a founder and accused me that my files are disorganized. I told them that I haven't met a single designer in my life who can claim that their in-progress work is organized. The founder gave example of restaurant kitchens that measure every ingredient and all, and said that he have zero knowledge if its true if your work is disorganised or not but I am telling from what I am hearing about. I was stunned, shocked and speechless at that time. Marketing guy knew that I fought to get the paid version of figma so I can get rid of the mess created by contract designers (all features in a single page), and the same person who knew I am making a design system on weekends and after office hours and have to spend so much time on clearing out the mess of previous designer which will never ever be counted, still he made such accusation. It turned out that he was asked from another founder about the UX copy exercise and since they didn't do it, he put all the blame on me that since the file is 'chaotic' and undocumented that's why they couldn't do it. The real reason was that he was not interested in taking the context and do it by himself.\n\nI was one designer against 3 PMs and a CPO, and once I tracked meeting times and found that its typical of me to go 20+ hour a week on meetings only. And each PM thought I am available for their work only, and they were frustrated that why I couldn't just handoff the design to them. The marketing guy just couldn't ever take a stance on anything, asked to explain him the product context and rationale behind every single design decision. Its extra step for me. And the sad thing is that step only produced bad outcome.\n\nSeeing that he is listened in the org and there is no way around it. I asked him to become the head of design since he is so much interested in designed. He backed off immediately to this idea saying that there is already so much in his plate. The real reason I can think of is that he would have to take accountability of the missed timelines whose impact was only I absorbing.\n\nEventually I made the CPO to get the marketing completely removed from every single step and process and my life got easier, and the product actually started picking up shape. I got promoted to a lead designer(even though I was the solo designer so it was meaningless). The marketing guy after sometime brought his designer friend and told everyone that he is as par to me or better than me. It turned out the new designer was a design thinking guru performative UX person who was only good at conducting entertaining workshops for non-designers.\n\nMy life again got hell for few weeks but eventually everyone realised that the new designer is a sham. And I got valued even more. But I left the org as I was being paid the same as the new one and was doing 98% of the work while he was allowed 3 weeks vacation and I was denied for even 3 days as so much dependencies were on me.\n\nIn my current org I am paid twice as much, and working along a design team. The only people interfere in my work are the designers. And there interference only enhances my work. I am so traumatized by the past org that I am trembling as I type. And the last I heard was that the ux performative artist is put on probation and about to be fired.	7	29

Whenever I received good grades, completed a piano performance, or celebrated a birthday, my mom would ask friends to bring pizza from the nearest city. Pizza, as the most vivid carrier of Western life, created a window for me to feel and experience the outside world. I still remember being amazed by the ostrich meat on the pizza and how we complimented the juicy Hawaiian pizza. Years later, the internet informed me that pineapple is not a regular topping for pizza, but in my memory, traditional pizza should definitely be served with pineapple.	11	21

I have horrible social anxiety and I can‚Äôt even talk normally without forgetting everything and stuttering when it comes to talking to people, let alone job interviews. I seem to do ok when it‚Äôs a 1:1 and it‚Äôs very casual. I actually got my first UX job after one short zoom call. But the pay is low and I‚Äôm not learning anything more, being the only designer. But the bigger companies and better paying jobs have 3+ interviews and are an hour long or more and I have never humiliated myself more when it comes to those because my anxiety takes over and it doesn‚Äôt matter how much I‚Äôve prepared, I always end up embarrassing myself because I can‚Äôt even talk properly. I‚Äôm about ready to give up, because I know I‚Äôll never be chosen over someone who is extroverted and loves to talk about themselves and their work. I come off not confident and the interviewers can sense that. I‚Äôm so lost and feel like a failure. I‚Äôve got a strong resume & portfolio, but can‚Äôt get past the interviews.

For example:\n\nOne cv scored low because of no identifiable bullet points. It very clearly did.\n\nAnother scored poorly based on what it called improper date formatting for the work experience.  The dates were there and readable.\n\nOther reasons for scoring low came down to formatting, weak adjectives, non regular section headings‚Ä¶.\n\nIn my assessment the tested CVs were well designed, and thoughtfully executed, the weaknesses were if at all mainly found in the content itself.\n\nHow messed up is it that a group of people more predisposed to crafting a well laid out (cos this is how we were taught) document can be rejected for those very reasons.\n\nUsing non standard glyphs, fonts and format is how we as designers show that we have a high level of executional quality and are detailed oriented in order to stand out, but there‚Äôs no point putting in that effort anymore. \n\nCompletely pisses me off that I‚Äôve seen product directors land executive positions and their CVs look as though someone with a barely working knowledge of windows vista (possibly relying on clippy for ai input) put it together - times new roman, maybe calibri if they‚Äôre feeling extra saucy, all centre aligned with about 60 words per line. You know the deal.\n\nIt seems that makers of the software cater for the widest possible market who don‚Äôt put effort in to their CVs and inadvertently discriminate the segment of workers that do.

I worked at 2 FANNGs most recently, smaller digital agencies, a large marketing/advertising agency and a medium size product company. This is why I am sick of being a UX designer:\n\n1. Constantly getting unsolicited, uninformed design feedback on WIP Figma files from stakeholders and having to explain countless times the design process and the UXR testing we rely on to help guide ux decisions, despite having processes in place for more formal design reviews that will be more informed and productive.\n\nMore generally, the constant feeling that everyone thinks they can do my job better than I can. \n\n2. Leadership offering up weak design solutions on the fly without really thinking about the user goals and journeys. \n\n3. Having to constantly wear multiple hats, fulfilling aspects of roles namely Product Management and Program Management due to the natural overlap with these areas, but no clear demarcation between what I‚Äôm responsible for vs them. Role ambiguity to the max. \n\n4. Only about 10-20% of my time is spent actually designing. The rest is presenting decks and mocks for deck updates, facilitating alignment, evangelizing concepts and vision work, negotiating product scope and launch milestones, working on cross team requests, bugs, the list goes on. A lot of the work is tedious and not fulfilling. \n\n5. Design leaders who are so incredibly out of touch and provide useless and counter-productive feedback.\n\n6. Lack of career upward mobility and the pressure to be more ‚Äúvisible‚Äù and ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù with work so that I can build a case for promo and essentially fight for it on my own, while already having roles and responsibilities that take 50-60hrs a week to fulfill. \n\n7. Eng constantly saying design is ‚Äúblocking‚Äù but once they get the approved design specs they take their sweet time and over-scope features saying they take x% more time to build than they actually do. \n\n8. Product managers who don‚Äôt know how to lead teams, communicate effectively and have  an ego the size of a bus not to mention massive control issues. Fun example: I had a PM who would use UXR findings as his weapon of choice when it suits HIS agenda, but when UX pushes for something different based on UXR results, he fights back saying it's a lower priority. Honestly he really sucks working with, and is the bane of my UX existence.\n\n\nSo yeah, I‚Äôm done lol. Moving on and out of the role and the tech industry. Super done. \n\n\nEdit #1: Thank you all so much for the responses.. seriously.\n\nA lot of you have asked what my next plans are. To be honest, I don‚Äôt really have one. I plan to take a career break and try to heal my mental health and reassess from there. I am working through some career assessments to see what else could be a fit for me. Ideally I want to do something that makes a positive impact on the world! Will keep you all updated. \n\n	414	567

The problem is that, the CEO has a lot of ideas, which is great because it seems like they need a ton of help, but we also do not have a PM/there are no processes set in place. Meetings usually don't have a conclusion. Here's some ideas I want to propose:\n\n1. Since it's a healthcare app that needs to be redesigned, I suggested we approach in a piecemeal approach. We can breakdown parts of the re-design through continuous improvement, and task it out/define core requirements from a feature-level.\n2. Put my PM hat and together a PRD\n3. After listing out all of the priorities and timeline, lock them in on a monthly retainer rate (at 10-20 hours ish a week) (obviously i'd rather lock them in at 20 hrs/week since I've been unemployed for while)\n\nHow would you guys approach billing/scoping these guys as a freelancer?\n\nRight now as far as an immediate need, he wants the homescreen to be improved, and then redesigning appointments, medications, and radiology. I know he wants the website to be redone too. The biggest impact projects would probably be: 1) improving drop off rate with the website 2) increase customer sign ups for the product.\n\nAppreciate the input!	2	1

I work for a very small company in the USA as an individual contributor and my team was lead by a PM who has no bg in UX.\n\nSince day 1, she and our CTO has been taking design decisions. I used to be handed off with half cooked scopes and I had to come up with design solutions. Since there were no users, there was no scope of research and so every decision was either based on the senior mgmts biases or assumptions.\n\nAnd I have helped them extensively to give the product some direction, but I was never acknowledged for any of it. It always came out as ‚Äúoh we were already thinking about this‚Äù or ‚Äúwe came up with an idea‚Äù that was discussed in 1on1 session that never acknowledged any of my involvement.\n\nAlso, I insisted of making the website mobile first and at least have a homepage. But until this point they think this is a waste of time.\n\nThe last conversation I had with my manager was about a home page concept I designed during my free time to help them scope out the actual one since our users were landing at random pages and according to them it didn‚Äôt matter.\n\nAnd then on Monday, they said I‚Äôm being laid off because my UX is not good. When they never truly believed in anything I suggested.\n\nOne more suggestion was to implement analytics that will show more than heat maps but that was rejected too.\n\nAnd the funny thing is that this company calls themselves to be ‚Äúfeedback forward‚Äù company, whereas while terminating my contract they gave a vague reply instead of a good feedback that might have helped understand the right areas where I lacked.\n\nI feel so shattered not because I got laid off but my work was demeaned. :(\n\nHere‚Äôs [my portfolio](https://meenakshibose.wordpress.com/), I would appreciate your constructive feedback.	114	153

I believed that if the design looked great, it would automatically lead to a successful user experience. This mindset led me to prioritize aesthetics over usability, often sidelining user research and feedback.\n\nOne particular project comes to mind. I was tasked with redesigning a mobile app for a major client. The stakeholders had strong opinions about the design direction, and I found myself accommodating their preferences without questioning them. I conducted minimal user research and skipped usability testing to meet tight deadlines. The result? A visually appealing app that users found confusing and difficult to navigate.\n\nThis experience taught me a valuable lesson: always advocate for the user. No matter how beautiful a design is, if it doesn't meet the needs and expectations of the users, it will fail.

I typically collaborate with the product manager to understand customer problems based on customer chat conversations. From there, I jump straight into wireframing and final mockups, relying on assumptions rather than user research or interviews.

I'm great in innovation spaces, having been working in AI for 8 years, and have been doing hardcore consulting for 10+ years. Name an industry or system, and I've probably designed it. Been working in the UK the last 5 years to escape an abusive relationship, and now thinking about returning. The thing is... the market is all UX developers, Directors, in the USA etc. 3 years ago I couldn't even look at my inbox on Linked In for all the senior positions, but it seems those are filled.\n\nI'm thinking I could be a director (I'm the head of design and research practice London for a major global consultancy) but I haven't directly done that... Any advice from seniors? How's the jump to upper management? I was thinking I could do another consultancy but I'm not sure if that's where I want to let my dreams die. Any advice is appreciated, this is not a request for jobs, but genuinely trying to understand where to go from here.\n\nupdate: my dudes, I will be applying to a series of AI startups and looking for product management roles, but also hedging my bets by getting that MBA (i always think i could be c suite so lets fucking see cowboys) there are no design roles in any big 4 consultancies in all of the USA. nor at any of the other standards I usually peruse. but europe is blowing up with need for product designers and seniors, the pay just suckssssss. Making a website on framer and putting together a side hustle for product coaching because lol, let's face it we are all product managers in the end. I keep working in spaces where I have to train product directors on how to do their jobs anyway, it might as well make me cash.	5	0

I actually really enjoy this type of work and consider myself a decent UX generalist. Or, I did.\n\nFor years now, I‚Äôve been the only UX person keeping a team of engineers supplied with 3-4 projects at a time. This means I‚Äôm answering questions about 3-4 projects in development, working on an upcoming 3-4 for teams to roll on to, and having open discussions about *dozens* of possible features with product and engineering managers. I‚Äôve been producing at least one completed feature design (or re-design) every week, for years.\n\nBurnout is inevitable in this situation, right? I am struggling, but feeling guilty about it. There are SO MANY problems to solve (30 on the roadmap right now!) that I sometimes just feel paralyzed. I don‚Äôt have the autonomy to decide what gets put in the queue, either. If 2 or 3 users request something, management green-lights building it.\n\nThere‚Äôs more -- like, all UX feedback from customers and the CEO alike gets posted in the company chat for everyone to see. This is not supposed to be a reflection on my performance, and I am not supposed to feel anything while reading it. If I ever admit to feeling overwhelmed, someone logics me to death about how feedback is data and data is a gift, and projects should simply be put in an order and executed one at a time. ""Are you blocking your calendar for focused work?""\n\nSomeone please tell me bigger companies aren‚Äôt like this.

There‚Äôs already been multiple employees who have become team leads, moved into IT, and other departments after a couple months after starting out as a CSR. \n\nThe company has no product designers so far but I know they‚Äôre hiring. I‚Äôve had four people forward my resume and portfolio to the director of product but haven‚Äôt heard back yet. I‚Äôve just been told to keep trying to make progress and prove my worth to be noticed.\n\nYesterday I had a meeting with the head of my department who is wanting to start gathering data to understand our customers and their journey in relation to our shopping experience. I‚Äôve broken our users down into three personas so far but have no idea what their motivations, frustrations, etc. are. I asked if he would be open to getting together to brainstorm what we know so far. He was very excited for it. \n\nI‚Äôve been part of workshops at previous companies before but have never ran one myself. I feel a lot of pressure about setting up this meeting and making sure it‚Äôs productive. I really want to sell both my value as a designer and the value of UX in general.\n\nIf I had to say what my goal is for this meeting it‚Äôs ‚Äúlocate the different user personas we have and write down everything we know about them so far so we can have a better idea of what we know versus what we don‚Äôt. This way we can work towards a better understanding of their user journeys‚Äù.  I feel like now I know my goal, I just don‚Äôt know how to run this workshop to meet it. I‚Äôd love some thoughts, resources, and tips to make this meeting successful.	13	7

Why do we often see outdated designs in the name of accessibility? Isn't this discouraging for designers trying to adopt accessible practices?\n\nAt the end of the conversation, while I advocated and gave him examples of many aesthetically beautiful resources out there, my mentee didn't look very convinced.\n\nAnd hence I turned to my Reddit UX family to gain some insights and thoughts."	72	32

I used to teach UCD and Usability testing at the Uni level. The pushback in the org isn‚Äôt daunting to me. I‚Äôve outlined a strategy, collected data and created content to persuade and influence the org.\n\nI hit the ground running and was kicking ass for 4 months even earning a bonus for the accolades I received. \n\nThen my company finally hired the second HCD person 4 months after me. They come from a customer service background. I didn‚Äôt interview them. We are the only two from this consulting firm. All others on our team are from a different firm. \n\nAfter they started I found out this person doesn‚Äôt have any UX or research or agile or OCM or devops experience. They also don‚Äôt have experience in consulting or with the platform we are supporting. \n\nI‚Äôm using the content I made for the org to train my new teammate on basics but it‚Äôs not sticking. There‚Äôs just so much to learn in a short time.\n\nThey are about to be through their 4 weeks of onboarding and they still don‚Äôt know the difference between a story and a solution or what we need Figma for. Among so many other things. \n\nI sometimes spend so much time teaching them new concepts I don‚Äôt have time to do the work and then have to find time a week later to redo their work. I‚Äôm no longer kicking ass. \n\nI‚Äôm frustrated because their questions and comments to customers or our team reflect on MY competence in UX/OCM because they think we are interchangeable.\n\nThey are showing initiative and reading books on user research and UX design  BUT they think it‚Äôs gonna work like how it says in the book. :( \n\nWe were supposed to be two seasoned veterans bringing change and now I feel like I have a toddler to teach and wrangle while I‚Äôm on an important sales call. \n\nI‚Äôve scheduled time with my supervisor to discuss. This situation is getting so bad I can‚Äôt see myself wanting to stay and work with this person. I don‚Äôt usually work on multi year projects like this so maybe I‚Äôm not seeing something. \n\nHas something similar happened to anyone else and do you have any advice? \n\n\nEdit: met with my boss today. He is going to take on the HCD training then we will see how it goes.	19	20

This action is set as a default action to have for files which in the case of PDFs, works, but does not work for let's say, photoshop files. In the photoshop file case where the browser fails to open the file, the file just gets downloaded. This then results in having two (download and open in browser) actions that do the same thing: download. We feel like this is repetitive, the ""open in browser"" action feels misplaced and gives users an expectation  that something will open in the browser. \n\nHowever, what I'm concerned about is defining the rules (for devs) for when ""open in browser"" should be an available action. There's a ton of file types out there that users can upload onto the web app that I don't know if the browser can handle opening. I also don't know if the type of browser used affects if a file can be opened by it. \n\nOr maybe this is a non issue and it actually is better for users to leave ""open in browser"" as an option?

I can't remember what I said as I didn't expect the question and pretty much blacked out, but they did send me to the next round where I could showcase my skills with a design task that they liked very much. Unfortunately, the company went to an unexpected recruitment freeze straight after so the position is on hold at the moment.\n\nI've got another job interview in a few days for a UX/UI designer position. I don't have enough time to add to my portfolio now (didn't think to do it after the first one), and they obviously like me enough to call me in for an interview, but I want to make sure I'm prepared. If they do ask me about my UI skills, what can I say? I trust that I have good taste, and a good grasp on the basics, but I'm also willing to admit that there is always more to learn. I haven't designed an app or website from scratch as there's always been a visual style and design system in place in my previous roles, so not THAT much UI-specific work was required.

How do we measure user delight? How do we measure if slapping on an illustration, writing a quirky copy, or adding a cool fancy microinteraction actually makes users mildly happier?\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this is because of the industries I‚Äôve been in, but I get so frustrated when, in design crits, other designers give me feedback like ‚Äúmaybe you can add a bit of user delight here, slap on an animation or something‚Äù and calls it a day.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong. I love pretty stuff. I love cool interactions. I too, would love to create the best ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù state with a cheerleader-like copy and illustration after a long wizard to make users feel like they‚Äôve achieved something. I‚Äôd love to spend 3 hours doing up a cool button animation. But here‚Äôs the thing. Nobody outside of design is convinced that these small ‚Äúuser delights‚Äù are actually making people‚Äôs days better. We terrible at measuring this kind of stuff. Even when I do user research, users are happy when we make processes as simple as possible so they can go spend time with their families, not when they see a quirky illustration that resembles them. Product people see these points of delights, but users - people that have a life outside of product - don‚Äôt seem to.\n\nSo when as designers we fixate on things like user delight, I feel like we‚Äôre driving ourselves to be seen as less seriously. How do you prove user delight? Just like how good type hierarchy improves readability - a tried and tested theory that actually benefits people - is there research I can use to rationalise my time spent on adding ‚Äúdelight‚Äù?	21	26

Some things I've noticed since I've been here is that the product leads of their product typically don't write JIRAs for their requirements. They usually give requirements verbally, through message, or email. If we DO get requirements, they're typically written by someone at a lower level who doesn't have the same historical knowledge or context as they do which leads to misalignment or inaccurate information sometimes.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is that design is brought in too late most of the time which leads to rushed timelines, exacerbated by the lack of clear written requirements. \n\nMy leadership has asked me how we could improve the collaboration between product and design team and was hoping this community could give me some actionable insights to help our team.

Unfortunately, I got laid off a few months back from my first position, which started as a 3-month internship and moved up to a mid-level position during my time there.  \n  \nI actually studied Business at university, but then I got into UX after finishing up a local bootcamp. Currently, I‚Äôm having a real hard time finding a new job.  \n  \nThrough the portal where I track my applications, I've noticed that only about 20% of the jobs I've applied for have been viewed by recruiters. And from those that look my application, maybe 50-60% actually checked out my portfolio. My interview rate is like 5% of whole applications.  \n  \nI‚Äôve made my cv using Teal and used all the right keywords, but for some reason, the recruiters are overlooking my profile:  \n  \nI've made two theories to explain this:  \n  \nMaybe it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt have a formal design education. While pursuing a master's degree could potentially address this, it's very costly, and as an unemployed individual with familial responsibilities (I'm married and have a child to care for) I would like to avoid that for while if it¬¥s possible. Also, going back to university dedicating time and resources to obtain another bachelor's degree from the beginning is simply not feasible.  \n  \nMaybe it‚Äôs my lack of experience. Seems like every job listing wants 4+ years, and using Linkedin Premium I can see that almost half the applicants have seniority and master‚Äôs degrees. Maybe the recruiters are only opening the applicants that have labeled ""seniority level"" on their profiles (really lazy job to evaluate applicants using this method, but must be a thing in this economy).  \n  \nI‚Äôve even tried reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn, but nobody never answers. I‚Äôve had some good feedback on my portfolio from senior designers, so I know it‚Äôs not that.  \n  \nAny suggestions on how to get noticed? I‚Äôm all ears.  \n  \nThanks a lot!"	32	21

The color doesnt match Brand colors in primitives if i just use a copy color tool of this surface that lays on top of our main background color. \n\nSo my question is do i just create a primitive with opacity and use it for Surface token then write to devs in design system card that this color uses opacity, or do i copy it and create a solid color primitive?

She's looking to transition to another company, so I've been assisting her in sending out CVs to various companies.\n\nBy the way, we're based in Italy, which I feel compelled to mention because the job market here can be challenging. Many companies tend to conflate graphic design with UX/UI, and positions that blend these skills are quite scarce, often attracting over 200 applicants.\n\nRecently, she was contacted by a large company that assigned her a take-home project. While I typically decline such requests due to the significant time investment they require, I encouraged her to proceed given the competitiveness of the field here.\n\nShe dedicated five full days to the project, encompassing research, user flows, LoFi/HiFi wireframes, component design, color/typography tokens, and prototypes.\n\nI must admit feeling somewhat disappointed when she only underwent an HR interview before receiving a rejection, without even an opportunity for a technical interview to discuss the substantial effort she invested in the project.\n\nNow, onto the questions:\n\n1. Can she publish a case study of her project on LinkedIn? Is it legally permissible, or could mentioning the company name pose potential issues? She aims to use it as an article to highlight her skills in the hopes of attracting potential recruiters.\n2. Would it be appropriate for her to include the project in her portfolio?\n\nI don't know if I'm allowed to share here the link of the Figma, let me know so maybe you could also give a brief look on it, I assure you it's a lot of good work\n\nThank you in advance for any insights!	19	21

Our goal for a while has been to rearchitect the flair system to make it easier and more accurate for posters to choose flair, and to indicate to readers when they might want to scroll past a post.\n\nWe have a report of about 1000 posts, which span from February to April 2024. Notably, between April 1 and 4 in this report, we did not actively moderate the sub to remove posts. (Automod was still active.) The report contains metadata like the author name, user flair, post flair, plus the title and body of the post. It also shows how many comments a post received, and a score generated by Reddit ‚Äî I don't know exactly how the score was calculated, but I can tell that it's used to determine which posts show up in ""hot"" or ""top"".\n\nI added a column called `New Category` and encoded a new system that I thought would more accurately reflect the purpose of each post. These aren't necessarily the final labels I'd choose for the flair, but they do express new approach for assigning topics.\n\nI do not believe my categorization is the correct answer, it's just a first step. I'd like to do some research with you all, and also see how AI might help. Based on this research, I'll plan to update the post flair and removal reasons.\n\nWould you be willing to encode this spreadsheet with categories that you think are relevant? Encoding a taxonomy is an art and a science ‚Äî not everyone is good at it or likes doing it ‚Äî¬†but hopefully some information architects out there want to take a crack at it.\n\n[Google Sheet of r/UXDesign posts, recategorized with new post flair](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vUu-WIA8MwwBrFHDYi2zvUYxFLqketWQ_Qvgi-oxvMs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nHere's my advice on how to do it:\n\n* Make a copy of the spreadsheet and rename it, put your username in the filename. Make sure the copy is shared with me, and comment on this post or DM me (comments preferred) with your version.\n* Look at the column `New Category` and see what I came up with, compare it to the current post flair, `link_flair_text`. Be sure to look at the earliest and the latest dates in the sheet ‚Äî¬†the posts after April 1 were unmoderated.\n* Add your own categories as desired. You can fill in the blank rows, add a new column, overwrite my previous categories ‚Äî it's all good. You can come up with your own categories or try to use the new ones I came up with.\n* Our goal is to develop a system that is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ‚Äî¬†ideally each post would fit into one and only one category, and there would be no uncategorizable posts. This is harder than it seems! I haven't done it with mine.\n* The labels should stand alone, without any additional explanation. Reddit does not allow a short description for each post flair, something I think would be quite useful. \n* Any input is welcome, but I'd prefer if you encoded at least 100 posts, so you're seeing the full range of topics.\n\nYour contributions will help us understand how you would like to assign post flair. They'll also help train a simple machine learning language model (LLM) on the past few months of posts, giving it their current post flair, title, and text, plus their new categories. Then, we‚Äôll be doing reinforcement training over the next month to see if the LLM correctly predicts where the real members of r/UXDesign put each post in the new taxonomy.\n\nWe‚Äôll also be using LLM-based summarization and clustering tools to identify any other distinct types content that emerge ‚Äî posts the members of r/UXDesign find valuable, but that don‚Äôt yet have a good category to live in. Our ultimate goal isn‚Äôt to automate the tagging process, but to make sure that the post flair is accurate, easy to apply, and is useful to sub members when scanning the feed."	0	11

And took time off of work and worked late into the nights to work on it. I didn‚Äôt have access to their components or design system so a lot of my time was taken up inspecting their assets on their live site so I could make a design accurate to their stylings. I provided 2 design options, had a review with them and then had to finalize one option for the following day - another lengthy ask. After this they wanted to do an in-person interview and paid for my flight to do another design assignment/interview, was at a location for 7 hours doing this, the same day I had to get up at 3am for my flight to the interview location because that was the only flight option that worked with their criteria, needless to say I was very exhausted. The final review of that assignment they were unhappy with a button placement and asked me to find a new position for it. Again not knowing their patterns or having access to them I blanked and couldn‚Äôt suggest a good option - for this reason it seemed like they decided to not hire me.\n\nAnyways they told me to send over an invoice for that paid design assignment along with adding any food expenses from the trip. \n\nI billed 36hrs and about $80 of food (excluded any drinks or anything of that nature). \n\nAround 2 weeks ago I send them the invoice with no response, followed up on Monday, still no response. \n\nNot sure what to do from here?

Happy to be proven wrong and it might be the articles I found, but putting it politely a lot of articles set off red flags for me of it being a kind of cargo cult practice (this comment is specifically aimed at people that can't explain what it is). It's not rocket science, it should be explainable in a simple and actionable way.\n\n---\n\nExample from: https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27\n\n&gt; User Story:As a moderator, I want to create a new game by entering a name and an optional description, so that I can start inviting estimators.\n\n&gt; Job Story: When I‚Äôm ready to have estimators bid on my game, I want to create a game in a format estimators can understand, so that the estimators can find my game and know what they are about to bid on.\n\nJust write a better user story? ""As a moderator, I want to create a game in a format estimators can understand, so the estimators can find my game and know what to bid on."". Who says user stories can't have a ""when"" in them? If we want to require that user stories have a ""when"" or another field in them, do we need to write a whole book about it?\n\nIf you're bad at writing user stories, you're going to be bad at writing job stories as well. User stories are just the start of requirements gathering too, it will get fleshed out later. I don't see what the magic here is that JTBD is meant to help with.\n\n---\n\nThe idea of ""hiring"" an app or a physical product to do a job doesn't feel intuitive to me at all either, it's not a good analogy to me. I don't see what this framing gives over the traditional ""As a, I want to, so I can"". ""I bought this thing to do X to make my life easier"" make perfect sense, the job analogy is just weird confusing wordplay to me.  \n\nExplaining the JTBD analogy to clients sounds really goofy and alienating as well. Requirements gathering with non-technical clients is hard enough already, I'm not going to introduce even a little jargon like this unless it has a big upside."	40	25

Many CS programs aren‚Äôt even adequate for developer roles, much less for design. Sure, I guess being able to communicate effectively with the dev team is nice, but getting a degree for that purpose alone is a bit of an overkill. As for psychology, I can see the case for experience in setting up studies and synthesizing data for user research, but not much beyond that, and there‚Äôs still a huge gap in skills separating a psych grad from even a junior UX role.\n\nUnless I‚Äôm wrong in my assessment, I wish people would stop recommending that students go into debt for degrees that aren‚Äôt really going to help them with the career they‚Äôre envisioning for themselves, especially with many schools now offering more UX-centric programs and including UX in their existing design programs, and not to mention all the bootcamp grads filling up the junior application queues.	8	0

I've been a *blank* designer for 7 years - blank because I did everything, from graphic design & branding to print stuff to assisting junior designers&copywriters to social media stuff to web design (both figma prototypes and wordpress) to app screens. I've worked in design agencies, advertising agencies and in house for a startup. I always found it hard to describe my job in a more specific word than just designer - and I thought that was not a bad thing (being adaptable and able to do all things visual) but it turns out to be working in my disadvantage.\n\nI've been trying to land a UX/UI job for years, but I just can't seem to land the right one. Companies that do UX/UI by the book (user research, testing their product, focus groups, etc etc) don't seem to want me bc I haven't proven myself in UX/UI particularly (as I tend to do a bit of everything and also they are discouraged by the advertising background for some reason, quote unquote ""it's a different field from ours"" which is legit i guess but still). The last two jobs I had, technically were UX/UI roles, at least that's what it says on the payslip.\n\n However, my problem is, in practice, I had very few UX/UI tasks. At most, I had to design some new screens and adapt some old ones, pitch some new features and show how they would look like in the app, but it was not ""serious"" - as in we never had resources to do it right. I made use with what I had, applied heuristics and user centered design principles and some vague personas/pain points where needed and mostly used common sense and it was enough for what was needed. But at the end of these years, I have nothing to put in my portfolio, I can't showcase these examples as they are not ""kosher"" and any serious job interviewer will see through the bs and think I don't know how to do this.\n\nThis makes me stuck in a vicious circle where the only companies that will give me a chance are the same ones that don't take UX/UI seriously or don't have resources/time/interest to do that. \n\nI would like some advice from people working in the field. Sorry I rambled so much, I am just a bit frustrated by this situation and I feel lost. How can I make the most of what I did at my last jobs and use that in my portfolio? Is there anyone there working in UX/UI and satisfied? I am getting so discouraged because so far in practice it's been nothing like I knew it to be in theory, everyone I met at these jobs is just guiding themselves by the principle of ""well I put this button there because I think it looks good"" which is not at all what UX/UI is about. \n\nThank you! \n"	36	50

You invested a disproportionate amount of time learning a tool that represents maybe 20% tops of the work that is truly needed for any design work that matters at an organization that is worth their salt. This might sound harsh, but I would like to hear how it is not correct.\n\nIf you are a UX Designer who spent the majority of their working time dealing with difficult clients, collaborated in cross-disciplinary teams, had a strong voice in every discussion, can go toe to toe with a UX architect, can support your developers at every stage of implementation, etc. you should have nothing to fear.

I also noticed some errors that the jury seemed to overlook. Although the website is currently down, it remains accessible in private mode.\n\nI advised the client on the fixes and the estimated time required. However, for reasons unknown, they opted for another consultant.   \n  \nRecently, driven by curiosity, I checked the site and found that while some errors were partially addressed, new ones had emerged. Worse, the developer broke all the ARIA labels while attempting a bulk modification with Regex, resulting in labels that now read `""aria-=""`.   \n  \nProperly implementing accessibility from the start would have added only a few hours to the project. It seems the client opted for cheaper solutions and is facing the consequences.\n\nI'm uncertain whether to inform the client about these issues.

On the other hand, I should not be inspecting a work in progress or relying on my prior access to the site.   \n  \n**What would you do?** I'm inclined to inform them, but I'm unsure."	13	1

UXDesign	2024-04-29 16:56:37		citylightstarrynight		UX Design		Need Advice: Handling Red Flags and Collaboration Issues in a New Product Design Role	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1cg45ac/need_advice_handling_red_flags_and_collaboration/	I just started a new product design gig at a media company three months ago so I am pretty fresh to this team and still learning their processes. I love the job so far and find it so fun, but three months in I‚Äôm starting to see some red flags. Some context ‚Äî this is an internal tool platform team which comes with its own cultural and organizational issues which might be compounding what I‚Äôm seeing. I‚Äôve worked on these types of teams/products in the past and have seen similar issues and they wore me down in a way I want to avoid this time around.¬†\n\nThis last week I was assigned an urgent ticket for a feature on a project that I haven‚Äôt been ramped on to yet. This project was in flight and close-to-done when I joined and the team seemed to make the assessment that design help wasn‚Äôt needed. Well now I‚Äôm getting tickets assigned to me as they finish implementation. This particular ticket is one dealing with a multi-player problem. Users can collaborate kind of like a google doc where they see each others changes reflected on the screen, though if they open a new tab of the same document, they need to close or refresh the old one to not be out of sync. The ticket is for a modal that displays to the user that they need to do this refresh. The ticket was assigned to me by eng originally without a due-date and with no other context (screenshots, recordings, etc) but a written explanation that I didn‚Äôt quite understand.¬†\n\nI don‚Äôt have much context on this project but this ticket at first glance seemed like a request for a new flow or something warning experience. I asked for more context to be added to the ticket and the engineer added a screenshot of another modal that exists in the app and said that we are just reusing this modal and that we just need copy to put into it. This was where I started to get a bit irritated. I don‚Äôt like to be told what design I should be making without giving something a fair assessment, and upon first glance this seemed like a lot bigger of a ticket than a simple copy change. A similar thing happened a few weeks ago and I acquiesced to that change since it was described to me that it was a low-stakes edge-case. I delivered copy changes but in this case eng requested for the copy changes to be displayed in the context of the UI. Another irritating request since we don‚Äôt have any kind of design system or component library that‚Äôs easily usable. The last time I swallowed this work, built the components from some old files and delivered the changes and they were accepted.¬†\n\nI had a similar issue with this modal in that I did not have any assets in figma to just reuse to build the design. I‚Äôm in the midst of leading our design systems project and thought this would be a perfect opportunity to let the team feel a bit of the pain of not having one by blocking this ticket and listing it as dependent on me building the component in figma. I checked with my manager before doing this and she was on board and loved the idea. The figma work would only take me an hour at most but I didn‚Äôt want this work to be invisible anymore. As you might already be able to deduce, labeling this ticket as blocked escalated the tension around it which led to a long back-and-forth slack exchange where one of the engineers firmly let me know that all they needed was a copy change and I didn‚Äôt need to deliver any UI. Then product came in to say that the due date is urgent and in a few days.¬†\n\nI‚Äôve been around long enough to know that this situation signals a problem. I‚Äôm also having some worries dealing with it this time around after having some on-the-job confidence issues following a layoff last year. Part of me wants to just put my head down and do the ticket and just say yes, but I also know my portfolio has suffered immensely from being on teams like this in the past. I also think leading culture-change on this team could be a good case-study in itself, and however painful, I think learning the skills to negotiate change in a positive way would be so valuable to learn. Maybe this is also me coping with the fact that I said no to an interview with a very cool company last week in order to put firmer roots down on this one before considering a job change because of culture-issues that I perceive as fixable. The product I build is in a dismal state, as are most internal platforms, and I have lots of data and evidence that usability is leading to efficiency issues that are impacting the business ‚Äî¬†so I do feel the team should care more about the user‚Äôs experience in this case.\n\nWhat would y‚Äôall do in this situation? I have already elevated the issue to my manager, and have a meeting with the PM later to discuss process improvements. I also plan to start having more 1:1‚Äôs with the engineers to better build rapport beyond everyday stand ups. I‚Äôve avoided this in the past by meeting with them on a project-basis because I know engineers hate having lots of meetings on their calendars, but it seems like I should have those 1:1‚Äôs explicitly. What can I do here to better build trust with the team and build a good culture of collaboration? I‚Äôm embarrassed to say that I‚Äôve started reading ‚ÄúHow to Gain Friends and Influence People‚Äù to upskill my communication skills. Are there any good books I could listen to to get a better grasp on this critical skill?	11	2

I noticed challenges among the seniors mentoring these juniors due to lack of coachability, knowledge gaps, limited critical thinking and lack of ambition to progress further after landing their first UX job. This lack of development meant we had huge knowledge gaps within the design team and a weak design culture where we had 0 design discussions. Whenever a design topic was raised, it often left the senior designers feeling frustrated and unsupported. This resulted in high turnover amongst the senior designers as the design bar was really low. This hindered the ability to provide high quality design solutions as no best practices were followed. \n\nIn my current role, I've observed that the juniors I work with have high ambition, curiosity and a strong desire to advance their skills. They have a solid design foundation from traditional education and started their design journey out of passion. My current design team is strong as I‚Äôm working with a lot more experienced designers and subject matter experts. Juniors are strategically placed in projects alongside senior designers to ensure a well-rounded and balanced teams.\n\nThis has led me to wonder whether there's a difference in quality between those who did a bootcamps versus those with more traditional design education.\n\nLooking forward to hearing all of your experiences :)\n	19	16

So it's never always fresh project with a fresh scope. I might be brought into a project halfway through as an example.\n\nThe project size varies also, it could be quite a massive shift directed from the business to a smaller experimentation idea from the data and insights team.\n\nI was initially thinking of creating a simple artifact similar to a PRD, that I could use on the various projects I'm brought in on to help capture the fundamental truths and figure out best next steps.\n\nI hope this question made sense and appreciate any insight.\n\nIf you need more context into my role and the problems I'm facing feel free to ask. 	9	5

The content can then be tweaked on the fly by again tweaking the parameters. Nearly all the parameters are on a spectrum (e.g. high cost to low cost).\n\nIdeally am thinking about GenAI experiences but I‚Äôm open to non-GenAI examples too.\n\nSo for example, say the web app generates blueprints of houses. The architect has to enter some parameters (at least one) before anything is generated, most of which will be on a range, e.g. cost, size, number of rooms, style, etc.\n\nThe app then spits out thousands of blueprints that the user now has to sift through or they can go back and tweak some of the parameters which will regenerate the results. The idea then is that the architect can select a single blueprint and tweak that blueprint some more by further tweaking the parameters.\n\nI‚Äôm specifically interested in seeing examples of similar parameter selection experiences, and then the experience of allowing the user to sift through their results and tweaking them by tweaking the parameters.\n\nHope that all makes sense!\n	2	0

But the job market has been just that for as long as I‚Äôve been here and it seems to be on the rise. The thought of making UI breaks my mind.

Despite recent leadership changes recognizing design's importance, I still feel sidelined and excluded from key projects and discussions. My suggestions for improvement often go unnoticed due to our small team and competing priorities, leading to feelings of chronic passivity and insecurity impacting my work and personal life.*\n\nI‚Äôm a designer at a company that‚Äôs currently undergoing significant changes, including new leadership and strategic shifts, to improve our results.\n\nThe company has in the past consistently undervalued design, with previous management showing little to no regard for the design function or our attempts to refine our processes and product. This often left me feeling marginalized and ignored by the product leadership, including my toxic boss, stifling my initiative and efforts. This attitude also spread to some team members, leading them to devalue my input and decisions.\n\nThankfully, our company has recently undergone a leadership transformation, with a new CEO and other executives, including a new CPO joining us after some organizational changes. The CPO recognizes design as a vital component of the product development process which is already making a positive impact.\n\nDespite these changes, I still feel sidelined and undervalued. There are major design-focused projects where they've brought in a consultant for one of them, within my expertise. I'm not only excluded from these projects but also from discussions where my in-depth knowledge of the product could be highly beneficial. These projects are also kept under wraps signaling a clear disinterest in external contributions or involvement. Because of this, I've been hesitant to intervene.\n\nThis approach feels particularly odd given our company's size. We are only two designers, each with a different specialization and assigned to separate teams. I'm more experienced in UI and interaction design. The other designer is deeply involved in one of these projects, yet we have minimal interaction or opportunities for collaboration. This person has significantly more influence than I do. In contrast, my influence is minimal.\n\nMy attempts to contribute often feel meaningless as many ideas remain unimplemented. I am also exploring solutions to enhance our design practices, such as implementing analytics to gather user insights, which would help me easily identify areas for improvement. But due to the small size of our team and competing priorities, my suggestions frequently go unnoticed and unimplemented, which diminishes my motivation. I feel constrained, struggling to increase my influence and growth within the company.\n\nI‚Äôm trying so hard to understand what I might be doing wrong or how I can better navigate as a designer. Over time, I've become almost chronically passive, affecting both my work and personal life. I tend to give up easily or sometimes make no effort at all. When I find myself with spare time, I struggle to identify tasks or new things to learn, which only heightens my sense of insecurity.\n\nI'm reaching out for advice and insights on how to navigate. Any suggestions on how I can assert myself more effectively as a designer within my company or strategies for overcoming feelings of passivity and insecurity would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read my post.	20	4

I am giving my career story here. I need to give you a full picture so you guys can give solution in that context.\n\nAfter my engineering from india(2013 passout), I got placed in one of the top MNC  for a developer role, but I dropped that offer and choose to find a field which I can relate more, with more research I found a role titled as UI designer ( Junior) which looked like a role which i can relate as I was good at designs and familiar with how a software product work. that was Basic knowledge of an engineering student. I gone for the interview without knowing a single design tool. i just installed an illustrator day before interview and played around it. but I didn't understand how it works to be honest with a single day. The company give a design test which i done somehow but very amateurish way, but the talk with manager after the test, manager told me to draw and sketch few items by hand i done that. then he told me i can join from next week as he told i got the skill only thing is to mold it. that's how i started my career as UI designer. which i worked on photoshop to create designs. but the way the work was i have to design a single screens 10-15 versions to present to manager. He was so good in that way it really tested my skills and i improved a lot in UI way. but i dont know anything about UX at that point.  Mostly taking inspiration from other existing products and presenting to stakeholder. there is no research part associated to it.I job hopped to next company in 2015. first company was mostly responsive and web dashboards and new company was mostly android and ios native apps. but still mostly UI jobs no UX part to it.\n\nThen in 2016 I got the opportunity for higher studies to come to canada and I opted mobile app design and development, mostly development of app and there is few design parts as well. as i have this much experience and passion towards design I was hoping to land in UI jobs in canada. but the role change at that point. it was UI/UX designer. I applied for many jobs as part time. got interview but lost due to ux part and lack of english communication. but one startup company came to my college and presented there app and details about their company. I know they are coming a week before and i gone through there app and created few designs which improved there customer experience and i got placed an an intern as part time in that company. i was so happy at that point as i got a door to canadian experience, but the story was horrifying as the tool they used was illustrator coz the boss only know that tool , as she was mostly doing the designs there. I told to boss its better to switch to sketch. that time was sketch very popular. but boss was forcing me to use illustrator . Boss make fun of my english always like in a meeting, she will correct me in front of other that you shouldn't say those words like in a rude way. and i got really embarrassed but i stayed there as i needed canadian experience. when days gone she become more rude to me design wise and personally. But i got to work with 2 big automobile clients as the app was focused on automobiles. I personally didn't have any experience in UX part like the research part. i only started with competitive analysis , inspiration on net and straight to design.  I know i was not right, but  boss need designs they dont need any research part to it. as i mentioned my english was not great but not too bad, to be honest, my way of convincing was bad. so then course almost going to end and i have to do coop i done my coop in the same company and thought of continuing there to get PR if i stayed there for a year i will satisfy for PR. but because of the pressure from boss. I quitted the role right after i got the workpermit for 3 years.\n\nI was jobless for 8 months. but I got in another company after that there also there is no UX process.  I never experinced any. but always from title was UI/UX Designer. I worked with clients no one bothered about UX part. I can say any kind of research i done was competitive anaylisis. then after that company i joined in a big candaian consulting where i workd as ux designer for a big 5 bank in canada. there also i was single designer in team mostly pixel pushing. Now I have 5+ years of experience in  canada as UI/UX designer but basically doing UI part. I have experience of senior role.  but i need some suggestions from you guys.  I am currently looking for other roles,  shall i look for a role which is senior or stay as mid level role and look for a place which have a standard UX process and study from that?\n\nThe boss part, I was venting out, as I still have that in my mind as a trauma.	6	0

The other project has a young optimistic staff member who once designed an app on a whiteboard and specifically asked to submit sketches of his thoughts where we can 'tidy up things from there'. \n\nI worry that if I completely shut them out they will be bitter about the whole process and resent whatever we design in prototype form.

Since it's an early-stage company, the culture around user research is just kickstarting. Although we do have a discovery process in place, we struggle to get qualitative feedback.\n\n  \nWhat we use is mostly a mix of email campaigns and in-app messaging, prompting our users to share their opinions or participate in a short survey -- but we normally get only \~1-2% response rate. We tried incentives a bit (gift cards etc.), but since we're getting so few responses, I also get a push-back for spending budget on incentivizing users.\n\nOne idea I have is to create a ""research hub"" with members of our users interested in developing the product with us. But this would for sure require some form of incentive.\n\nThe goal is to have a cadence around gathering qualitative user feedback, a source of information that can be segmented and reached as easily as possible.\n\nHow did you go about this at your company?  \n"	5	1

I'm one of the many in this sub who've been unemployed for ages. I've been a designer for 12 years now, and a UX researcher before that. I think the biggest obstacle to my getting a job in this current market is that I am not an artist. I've never had to be. There was always someone else on the team who did the ""pixel perfect"" art, usually with the title of Artist. I can do great mockup art, I can build and usability test prototypes, and I can write an airtight functional spec that will sail through dev. It seems like no one cares. **The people holding the keys to employment these days think design = art.** Or they at least think art is the only the place designers can come from. We all have biases, and we all want to choose people who are like ourselves. I get it. But hey I need to eat.\n\nI certainly have the resume to prove I'm good at what I do. High falutin awards, an App of the Week, a hardware product that was well-reviewed by Wired and currently resells on eBay at twice its original pricetag. But I don't have a job, and I feel no closer to getting one than I was a year ago.\n\nI've been referred to jobs by colleagues, but in the end they pick someone with an art background. The people who used to give me freelance work have either left tech or are unemployed themselves. I only worked for a handful of companies in 12 years, so while I know a lot of people in the industry, the number of people I have worked with directly feels somewhat small.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?

UXDesign	2024-04-23 19:08:23		Alarming_Ruin6241		UX Strategy & Management		Linear app built $400M issue tracker with next to no marketing ‚Äî here's how	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1cbcziw/linear_app_built_400m_issue_tracker_with_next_to/	"*That‚Äôs the story of the fastest-growing and most beloved issue-tracking tool in the world with a $400M valuation, more cash than they ever raised, and cult-like following ‚Äî all with just a $35k lifetime marketing spend.*¬†\n\n*How the heck did they manage that?*\n\n# 1. Founders‚Äô pedigree\n\nLinear's founders - Karri Saarinen, Jori Lallo, and Tuomas Artman - arrived on the scene with impressive Silicon Valley backgrounds:\n\n* Saarinen and Lallo had previously founded a Y Combinator startup before selling it to Coinbase, where both held early roles;¬†\n* Saarinen later also worked as a design leader at Airbnb.\n* Artman was an Uber engineering leader.¬†\n\nAs Artman himself admitted, they ""consciously took jobs in Silicon Valley to prepare for their next startup."" Smart move, if you ask me.¬† Not saying that the founder's brand guarantees success (hi there, Hyperloop). But those kinds of credentials give you an unfair advantage compared to beginning a sprint halfway through the race:\n\n* Thanks to their large Twitter followings, founders managed to line up 10,000 people for the waitlist for their closed beta.\n* And who were those early beta users, you ask? Oh, just a few of the buddies from these little future unicorns like Cohere, Runway, and Ramp.\n* Around the same time, Sequoia partner came knocking with a $4.2M seed round because, ""people she trusts in her Twitter network were hyped about Linear.""\n\n**Lesson #1: Do your founder‚Äôs homework.**¬†The path to startup success starts way before your big idea ‚Äî it starts from learning from the best, networking, building up your reputation, your personal brand, and your bank account.\n\n# 2. The problem Linear‚Äôs solving\n\nIn his time at AirBnb Karri Saarinen noticed a strong negative sentiment towards the incumbent software in the issue tracking space (in other words, everyone hated Jira).\n\nSo he created a Chrome extension to simplify Jira, and that extension took AirBnb‚Äôs product team by storm. There was clear interest in simplifying and beautifying issue tracking. So Linear aimed to solve inefficiency of existing project management tools for small dynamic startups, and specifically ‚Äî for developers at those teams.\n\nYou can't be perfect for everyone, so when you create a tool for developers, it's gonna suck for PMs. And if you focus on small startups, bigger companies won't use it ‚Äî but that's okay.\n\nLinear focused on having product-market fit in small segments, and having it strong. As Karri Saarinen explains, in the first two years, they focused on, ""getting the fit in the early stage startup segment"" Basically, the goal was to become the default startup‚Äôs choice ‚Äî and that's exactly what they managed to pull off.\n\nAs they started getting larger companies, they noticed that ""Yeah, it's not really great for you right now, but let's work on it, making it better,"" and that is Linear‚Äôs product-market fit strategy for the next few years.\n\n**Lesson #2:¬†Focus on your niche**\n\n* Focus on it as you‚Äôre looking for product ideas. Don‚Äôt go for something really, really original. Chances are, there's just not enough demand. Instead, find an underserved segment that the big flexible players are ignoring. Make something opinionated and tailored for them, and you have it.\n* Focus on your niche when looking for product-market fit. If you try to be good for everyone, you'll end up being good for no one. First win your segment, then use that momentum to expand.¬†\n\n# 3. The product and design\n\nLegends say Linear was born fully-formed from the sea foam one day in June 2020, embodying the beauty of product design. But the real story is a bit more down-to-earth:\n\n* Stage 1: Idea validation, which took place yet in AirBnb as you already know.\n* Stage 2: Concept incubating.\n* Stage 3: Collecting a waitlist and launching a private beta ‚Äî all within just a few months of starting to incubate.\n* Stage 4: MVP validation in a closed beta for a full damn year, slowly onboarding those waitlist participants.¬†\n* Stage 5: Only then did Linear's software become publicly available. But by that point, they had a polished look and feel, over 1,000 customers and raving fan reviews.\n\nWe usually speak about Linear as a design-driven company because of their focus on aesthetics and reducing friction for users. But the under-the-hood thing that really makes it a design-driven company is getting your initial concept tested on real users as soon as possible for as long as possible. Linear still tests each new feature in beta before launching it officially.¬†\n\n**Lesson #3: Get out and test.**¬†UI/UX design is my bread and butter, and I can guarantee you this approach is worth stealing. Resist the urge to hide in your cave and polish whatever you‚Äôre working on. Let people help you. Early feedback will save you from pouring hours into features or design elements that your customers don't even care about.\n\n# 4. Product-led growth traction\n\nAs a collaborative tool, like Loom or Figma, Linear benefits from powerful network effects. One person starts using it, invites their team, which then invites other teams ‚Äî making Linear spread organically inside companies.\n\nThis, combined with Linear's focus on delighting users allows the product to essentially sell itself through a bottom-up adoption model. No need to pour tons of money into ads when the app is winning over users one team at a time.\n\nThe network effects partially explains why Linear has been able to achieve such impressive traction with a minimal advertising budget.¬†\n\n**Lesson #4: Evaluate your product-led potential.**¬†Product-led growth can be super effective, but it's not for everyone. Definitely not for some nerdy non-collaborative B2B SaaS tools. Don't just chase the latest growth buzzword ‚Äî the key is being honest about whether you have the right ingredients to make it work.¬†\n\n# 5. Compelling product narrative\n\nDo you have that feeling that there's something more powerful at play beyond the rational reasons for Linear's success? It goes deeper than just creating a useful tool.\n\nLinear has taken a strong, opinionated stance on software development. They're in direct opposition to Silicon Valley's ""fail fast"", data-driven approach of A/B tests, KPIs, and rigid teams.\n\nInstead, Linear believes in craft, taste, flexible goals, and empowered individuals. And people who resonate with Linear's cultural beliefs don't just see it as a product ‚Äî they feel a sense of identity and belonging that goes way beyond functionality. For them, Linear becomes the obvious choice.\n\nThis kind of soft power is what elevates great brands like Apple and Stripe. And it's clearly working wonders for Linear as well.¬†\n\n**Lesson #5: Brand is what you stand for.**¬†Not the colors, or fonts, or logos. If you make your beliefs resonate with the¬† audience, your potential gets supercharged.\n\n# 6. The naming dilemma\n\nProduct name ‚ÄúLinear"" doesn't seem to be the best choice. Google search (reasonably) gives linear algebra results.¬†\n\nLinear‚Äôs team ambitiously expected they could beat the brand that‚Äôs dating back as far as 4000 years ago. In their brand guidelines, they state that ‚ÄúLinear‚Äù should be used as a single word, (not ‚ÄúLinear app‚Äù).\n\nI don‚Äôt personally believe they can handle that competition (and I put ‚ÄúLinear app"" in the title so I don‚Äôt confuse you people) but the company strictly follows its guidelines with impressive self-confidence.\n\n**Lesson #6: Everyone messes up sometimes.**¬†Even founders with Coinbase, Uber, and Airbnb on their resumes are not immune. And that‚Äôs okay.\n\nDoes anyone know how they ended up calling themselves Linear by the way? I'd be sooo happy to see insider details in the commentsüåö\n\nPS. Cruel Reddit rules don‚Äôt allow me to accompany this text with contextual memes, and it makes me dramatically sad (just like Dramatic Dmitry with sand gradually falling through his fingers). But fear not. You can see the original text with all the memes¬†[here](https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/linear-app-case-study#toc-5)."	10	45

(https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1350009882561653229/selection-texts for those might be interested)\n\nMy previous plugin addressed the issue of managing text properties in multi-selected elements, which often fail to display text panels or show mixed properties.(I got real frustrated by this experience over years)\n\nWhile the some said would be helpful(mostly who are in a free sketch stage), I learned that designers using predefined Styles found it less useful cause they can bulk-edit texts in Styles anyway. However, this important feedback indicated that even those with Styles struggle with repeated process of creating, linking and unlinking texts to Styles.\n\nIn response, I am now enhancing the plugin to provide comprehensive text control over the selected area and facilitate easy linking of texts to styles.\n\nCould you share UX feedback or opinion on if you would want this in your daily UX workü§î Thanks!\n\n	0	0

Thats what the job basically is about. The problem I have is that at least to me it seems that ""UX Designers"" are not able to write clear problem statements anymore. I don't know if it's just my personal flawed expectation but it always seem like OP's these days do not take any time to write more than just 2 sentences, to do any research themselve or to give enough context about the situation that might help us give more qualified answers. \n\nI mean, I also see topics/comments where people point with fingers at others for not using auto-layout for example. However, at the same time when you point them out for not using the reddit search before posting a redundant topic they get offended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA good example of topics I miss to see more of is:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1c1mbwv/data\_hope\_for\_your\_job\_search/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1c1mbwv/data_hope_for_your_job_search/)\n\nThis was a topic by a ""UX Designer"" I was really happy to see in the sub:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* OP wrote a clear problem statement\n* OP took action and described how he/she proceed\n* OP shared what he/she learned \n* OP even revealed some data \n\nThis gives a lot of content for a fruitful, productive and fact driven discussion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm aware of Murphys Law that this is just an anonymous online forum and due to the low entry barrier it mainly attracts a certain group of people. However, it seems that for a UX sub aimed at professionals some topics seem to be very superficial and people do not take any time to write clear problem statements nor to do research themselve anymore. \n\nSo, my questions are:\n\nAs an ""UX"" community where do we currently draw the line for our quality standard? Are there minimum requirements for topics?\n\nHow do we deal with redundant or low quality topics?\n\nAlso what is the decision making process behind removing topics? There are cases where the same topic sometime gets removed and sometimes not because the reason varies?"	0	0

I am part of a small US design team consisting of myself, another designer, a usability testing specialist, and our supervisor (who¬†pretty much¬†acts as a Product Owner). While we have Local and Global POs for the project, they are¬†largely¬†useless to us, which is a much larger issue I¬†won't¬†delve into here. My manager is design-focused and supportive of change, but progress stalls beyond her role in the organizational hierarchy.\n\nIn summary, the product I work on falls under the ownership of the Global side of our business, where decisions and designs are centralized, and changes cascade to various countries in development. I would say that the business¬†as a whole¬†is moderately design¬†mature,¬†but nowhere near where it should be for a¬†business¬†of this scale. There are much¬†larger¬†issues in the organization, but one¬†of them is that the Global teams are not very receptive to the design suggestions/improvements¬†that the¬†countries provide to¬†them,¬†despite being backed up¬†by research and data from customers who currently use our channels.¬†Siloing within and between¬†teams, both¬†locally and globally,¬†makes it¬†difficult¬†to see sustainable progress.¬†We‚Äôre¬†fed lies from our higher leadership that change is on the horizon¬†but¬†it¬†never comes (shocker, welcome to corporate America¬†I¬†guess).\n\nThe problem for me¬†specifically¬†though¬†is that my progress has become extremely stagnant¬†and¬†I‚Äôm afraid¬†won‚Äôt¬†be transferrable; I feel¬†extremely¬†stuck in my role here¬†and¬†I¬†have become very apathetic toward my work.¬†I have worked on this project for¬†a total of¬†almost¬†3¬†years with¬†almost¬†no real work to show (that has shipped) due to the decisions of larger Global teams taking precedence. Every design that my team and I bring to stakeholders in the project is rejected or highly altered in favor of those created by the Global design teams.¬†\n\nI would say that my salary is appropriate for the area¬†I live in, I¬†have great benefits and¬†an amazing¬†team (locally),¬†great¬†work-life balance, I love the company overall, etc.¬†which¬†makes this all even more difficult for me. I feel stuck here but am¬†not sure¬†how to proceed and take the¬†next¬†steps to get out. Should I use the free time I have to learn more transferable skills?¬†Get¬†a design mentor to hone in on¬†the things that¬†I can improve upon?¬†Work¬†on personal projects to beef up my portfolio? I am fed up with the repetitive empty promises¬†made by¬†leadership, I really love design and want to see growth in myself and my work.¬†Although¬†the state of the job market and my seeming lack of skills make it easy for me to regress and stay¬†put¬†where I feel comfortable now.	3	3

They mostly just changed colors or button sizes.\n\nThis time, the app is really simple, especially a home view has just showing scores, count of screens, and a button to watch videos.\n\n\n\nCould even such a simple app benefit from finding a talented designer?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kk1ek3vo7zvc1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=205bfe96b170e73088f2d3ba6502e00fe5fb2e7a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4riu4vo7zvc1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f369358f884a42b2327e8656f925f67467bec15\n\n	12	0

I also wanted to share as many details as possible (without exposing myself!), because transparency is great and unfortunately it seems like there's not a lot of data!\n\nStats: small Canadian university (west coast), 3rd year graphic design student, one prior internship that was literally at my university\n\n[Sankey diagram](https://imgur.com/dWKqT14) charting how it went\n\n* I started applying early January 2024 and stopped late March 2024 (when I got my offer confirmed). I applied primarily to Canadian positions (locally and nationally).\n* I found most jobs through LinkedIn and Indeed (and would follow the link to the company's career portal and apply through there). My design program has a required internship component but career services is basically useless.\n* It did seem like there were much less internships this season, especially compared to summer 2022; I feel like on average there was only about 5-10 new design intern postings per week in Canada, and that number dropped significantly by mid-late February.\n* What I wanted the most was some kind of design internship where I'd be working in the digital design space (product, UX).\n\nMore specific details:\n\n- Government of Canada summer student job: hiring manager reached out -&gt; told them I was no longer looking due to accepting another offer\n\n- Another Government of Canada summer student job: hiring manager reached out -&gt; did an interview -&gt; withdrew from process due to accepting another offer\n\n- GeoComply: assessment (quizzes + one-way video interview)  -&gt; not selected\n\n- Siemens: withdrew my application \n\n- A senior designer was planning to take me on as a design intern with their team for the summer, but due to some company stuff, it didn't end up working out :(\n\n- A referral to AMD resulted in a rejection a month later \n\n- The only referral/application that worked out was one from a professor I'm close with; I was connected with a local design agency, who interviewed me, offered me an independent contractor gig in February (I was working beside school), and in late March, decided to keep me for the summer (ETA: the position is remote, paid $22 CAD/hr)\n\n- [Here's the Notion](https://stellar-alarm-bc9.notion.site/6e888ba9523c48a7874390e714e035bc?v=13d1a30a462247eb8462cca6c4b0bb9a&pvs=4) I was using to track what jobs I was applying to (and their job descriptions for if I ever moved on to the interview stage, which I did not ü•≤), here's my [resume and portfolio](https://imgur.com/a/79LJIjp) for reference\n\n**So, what did I learn?**\n\n* I suppose it's true that all it takes is one yes.\n* Connections really do matter; if it wasn't for my professor, I wouldn't have an internship this summer.\n* Local design groups, in my experience, either don't really like students, or are quite cliquey. I tried joining and being active in some of them (just trying to get to know people, not demanding a job or anything LOL), and my experience wasn't that great. In one of them, a notable designer was actually quite passive-aggressive with me. üíÄ\n*  Online design groups don't really seem relevant for design students in degree programs either. They seem more geared towards bootcamp students or career transitioners.\n* Design orgs (in Canada, we have the RGD) are not very helpful either. It's not very advantageous to apply to the same x number of internships that every other student in Canada was applying to.\n* RippleMatch is kind of useless, I feel like it's more useful for American students.\n* Trying to connect with recruiters/hiring managers on LinkedIn after applying to an internship makes no difference ‚Äî I was ignored in all cases, but I don't blame them, their DMs may be getting flooded by students.\n\nI honestly have no idea what to expect with regards to junior designer positions once I get my degree (Will there be more openings? Will there be less? Is it worth going to the states?). What I do know, though, is that I have a lot to grow and develop in order to become competitive for opportunities after grad.	11	39

I haven't seen much discussion about this, but there are already some startups creating products for AI-led user interviews, including real-time conversations. User interviews are one of the most time-consuming activities in the UX process, and I think this development will have a huge impact on UX jobs and functions. It's already challenging to see widespread implementation of research in most parts of the market. I believe these tools have the potential to include more user feedback and insights in the process, but at the same time, specific UX research positions may disappear or change significantly in scope if these tools deliver on their promises.	27	0
UXDesign	2024-04-20 14:20:30		lexilexi1901		UX Research		How far do I go with the documentation/presentations?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1c8r4zb/how_far_do_i_go_with_the/	"Hello :) I'm a junior UI/UX freelance designer and I've been asked to ""redo the UX"" for my client's (agency) client. I initially thought I had to redo almost *everything* related to UX, down to the goals. I don't have a lot of contact with the agency's client because my client handles all meetings (i think because i'm not experienced enough). My client gave me his client's feedback, their staging app, and a miro board with his thought process. He told me to go through the research phase, add suggestions, evaluate the feedback, compare with the competitor, and create wireframes. \n\nI recently did a lot of research regarding UX because I didn't feel like I had enough knowledge. School didn't teach me a lot of UI/UX because they focused more on graphic design and game design, and the company I was an intern for before had me doing marketing design. So I figured I should go through research and follow that. This research is obviously structured for a new project so i studied all about problem statements, internal stakeholder interviews, creating personas, etc. \n\nConsidering this isn't a new project, I clearly didn't need to revamp everything since the clients already know their customers and have some feedback. But -- especially for my sake because i'm very organised -- i wanted to start with the problem statement to confirm with my client that I understood him and that there's a consensus on the goals. \n\nI provided the problem, the objective, the opportunities, and the solutions. I kept it very vague because this was just the first step and I didn't want to get lost in the details. \n\nSo i then sent him the document and asked if we could do a quick survey with no more than 5 customers just to get to know them. UX requires a lot of user knowledge and I didn't feel like i knew the customers/users enough to practice the ""empathy"" principle of UX. He asked for a meeting and told me:\n\n""Yes, this is good. And i like your organisation, i have praised it before. But this is your first job in which the clients are paying for and they don't want it to take too long. I know their goals and if I were to present this to them, they wouldn't feel like anything productive has been made. The document looks nice and organised, but this would be more helpful to look back on later on. I want you to break down what I presented on Miro and challenge my thought process, and to create wireframes"". \n\nI asked if they had a UX flow and he said they didn't. I said ""Alright, no problem, I'll try to figure it out using the staging app"" but he didn't look too pleased using time to create a UX flow. My goal was to understand what's going on because their UX was that bad that I felt lost in the app. And in order to figure out how to fix it, I need to know it. \n\nA day after the meeting he sent me a photo of the book he was reading on UX that stated we don't need a detailed report because it's not worth the time and effort. For teams, there's no time for written reports"". I didn't argue with him and thanked him for the message.\n\nMy question is, would I really be wasting time making sure that we have a statement documenting a consensus on the goals, that we have user personas, and UX flows? \n\nMy intention was to save time for later because I know that when stakeholders don't agree on the goals and strategies, things need to get redone and reevaluate over and over. I experienced it in the company I was an intern for. And my client just planted this project on me so I have little to no knowledge about his client's company or goals. I felt lost on hoe to proceed and where to start and how far into revamping do I go. \n\nWireframes take a lot of time and i know that having to constantly change layouts and flows will take time, effort and money. I don't want to then be blamed for taking too long to launch the platform. \n\nWhat I've done since that meeting is spend a lot of hours researching to challenge, back up, or add on to what he presented on Miro. I researched QR codes, how to streamline the onboarding process, and the industry in general (how similar apps work). I did something similar to him which is creating trees of boxes with sticky notes using minimal text so that the clients can visualise the thought process. \n"	7	7

UXDesign	2024-04-19 21:55:51		PoorDaguerreotype	Experienced	UX Strategy & Management		Refactoring our Figma component library to leverage variables using primitives and semantics. Liking it.	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1c895kt/refactoring_our_figma_component_library_to/	\nWe‚Äôre a mid size scale up with a mobile app and web platform. We‚Äôve built UX flows that are simple, clear, and follow intuitive cross-platform patterns. We‚Äôve invested time in simplifying both the product and what users need to do to accomplish their goals. Plus we stay close to our customers and have pretty standard instrumentation to understand how the apps are used, so are able to quickly zero in on friction. We‚Äôve focused our efforts on delivering outcomes for users to a quality standard that‚Äôs exemplified by our reviews like 4.9/5 on the Apple App Store.\n\nBut, in maintaining a consistent pace of delivery with a lean design team and an expanding the product means the UI has grown some inconsistencies: similar but slightly different components, a few unnecessarily different icon sizes, occasionally different colours are used for text, borders, dividers etc.\n\nNow the product is growing in complexity and expanding into new domains. It‚Äôs time to refactor the UI to smooth developer handoff, build in a more scalable way, and smash inconsistencies before we expand the UI to be so large it would take a hundred designers to tidy things up. We‚Äôre a design team of 2.\n\nAmong the first details we‚Äôre nailing down is colour. Enter Figma variables. Up until now we‚Äôve used shared styles in our core library with names like black-500. This was fine since we could set these up as variables in the frontend. The problem is when e.g. setting body text in a new screen, should that be black-500 or black-600? They‚Äôre both accessible on our background colours - so we‚Äôd just eyeball it. When you‚Äôre a lean team supporting 5 product teams and a marketing dept, done is better than perfect.\n\nAs of a couple weeks ago we‚Äôre making time to refactor our core library and tidy these things up - notice I said making time and not taking time, we‚Äôre still shipping. We‚Äôre keeping our core palette mostly the same, but have introduced new semantic colours with names like text-primary and text-secondary. Now there‚Äôs no question what to use, whether applying to text, borders, backgrounds, specific elements etc.\n\nWe‚Äôve also taken the same approach to spacing with semantic spacing variables we‚Äôve given names like between-paragraphs or between-lists that are set to different units in a spacing scale.\n\nThis removes any doubt about what to use in the moment you‚Äôre selecting values in Figma, without the need to constantly check guidelines or reference material. Beautiful!\n\nThis is actually much easier to do retroactively. At the beginning, we didn‚Äôt know what we needed because we were discovering as we built. Now, we‚Äôve completed a UI audit with the help of some design-curious colleagues and have a view of the design patterns that have emerged organically - so we can just zero in on what works and remove what doesn‚Äôt.	10	16

Like, I could understand if this was MyFitnessPal or something else in the health/security space; however, getting triggered by a sarcastic cartoon owl telling you to practice Spanish feels like something that should be addressed by a therapist. Not a UX designer. \n\nP.S. please do not go find and harass this person. I anonymized it for a reason. It has over 1000 engagements, though, so feels like fair game to comment on.	77	314

Not a ton of context around user data or anything, but I ended up being happy/proud of my end result, and I feel that I made some well-informed design decisions overall. \n\nI ultimately was not selected for the role (I did ask if they had any feedback to provide on my design and have yet to hear back), but I still feel that it could be a good portfolio piece. \n\nIs it a weird/bad idea to include it in my portfolio?

For example, most of us can agree what a card is, but searching for a swipe up menu yields wildly different results. \n\nLooking through this sub I found uxdictionary.io which is a good start for basic UX terms. This is mostly abstract terms about research, user flows, etc with less info about actual components. \n\nI‚Äôve also searched through Google‚Äôs material design library and I‚Äôve noticed different companies/designers call components by different names. \n\nTL:DR Is there a visual resource for component names? 	8	3

In the company I‚Äôm currently working at we try to have a consulting type of role when talking to clients or in projects. This can be in design itself or in roadmaps or project prioritization.\n\nI‚Äôve seen some companies mostly do implementation or fully consultancy. My question is: what do you do and why? \n\nI believe being at the strategic table can be quite demanding and can sometimes diminish or slow down project work.

The trouble I am having is that I'm not sure where to start, since I am not privy to that information for the purposes of this assessment. The instructions from the recruiter are as follows:\n\n&gt;Audit the UX/UI and any other performance indicators that you‚Äôd to focus on for {website} then offer improvement ideas that will help drive their business objectives.\n\n&gt;There are obviously some things that you don‚Äôt know since you haven‚Äôt talked with them like we have, but you can make assumptions based on prior experience with similar clients\n\n&gt;The way you‚Äôd like to present your findings and suggestions in this meeting is entirely in your creative realm.

I've worked in a company where a design system was already in place, but I worked on building and maintaining it, worked on new components and interaction states etc. I've been using Figma for years, I'm very focused on accessibility and I also have extensive experience in user research work. \n\nMy portfolio has a couple of good projects in there, one showing an iterative design process, one is a project where there was a very tight deadline and interesting data challenges. I also showcase my work on the design system.\n\nI've been looking for work for 4 months. During one interview, I was told my UX portfolio is strong, but they asked how much UI experience I have. Can't remember what I replied, but after the interview I was worried they wouldn't get back to me. To my surprise, they actually did proceed to the second round with me, where I had the chance to showcase my UI skills in a design task. I got really positive feedback, but unfortunately, the company then went to an unexpected recruitment freeze, which I was so sad about. They did tell me they would reach out in a few months, so I'll see how that goes. \n\nI've just had another intro chat with a recruiter for a startup company. Didn't make it through to the next round because apparently they found a candidate with more UI experience. Of course, as I only spoke to a recruiter, we didn't talk about my design skills in particular so this decision is clearly off the back of my portfolio. \n\nMy question is- how do I, as a UX designer, showcase specific UI skills? I have not had any work experience where UI is the sole focus, so I don't know how to highlight that more. I haven't designed an app or website from scratch, without the existence of a style guide/design system/brand already, and I don't really think it's realistic to expect that? I'm so bummed so any advice would be great!	11	3

Needless to say minds were blown and from that moment the same VP product demanded weekly usability tests.\n\n---\n\nWhat were your good experiences as UX/product designers?	1	2

The direct users are Customer Care Representatives and the indirect users are credit card who have contacted the customer care representatives.  \nI have no access to the indirect users for user research to understand their needs and study behaviors.  I however, have access to the recordings of the calls between the Customer Care Reps and the credit card users. There are probably thousands of call recordings and I can filter them based on country, use keywords to search for relevant conversations (ex- if I want to listen to conversations related to transaction queries, I can use keywords to filter out the conversations to narrow down the same).  \n\n\nI am working on a key feature where the Customer Care Representative clears queries related to transactions. I can't conduct user interviews at this moment due to lack of time. All I have is P.O.D screens and I need to redesign the journey using the new design language adapted by the corporation. I can conduct UX audit of the existing screens journey and screens but user  study will give me more information.  \n\n\nHow many calls I need to listen and what process I need to follow to highlight the pain points of the users and the way it affects the business? There are literally thousands call recordings available. I need to listen to them to understand the conversations related to the feature. I have just a week left with me to submit the first draft. There are calls which last for just 4 minutes (including the IVR) and a few calls that last 40 mins. How do I choose the calls and which process should I use to map down my observations?

The whole thing seems oddly urgent and I didn‚Äôt really know why. I was told that it will be an hour to present 2-3 case studies, but when I got the invite it was only 30 minutes. I thought it was a mistake and asked her, she told me that no it will be an hour it was just a mistake in the invite, but when I got to the meeting the hiring manager confirmed that it will be for half an hour. The recruiter also told me that there will be 1 person interviewing me but turned out to be 4. I think all in all, I haven‚Äôt prepared for the interview well enough knowing what I know now. I did my best presenting the case studies with the amount of time I had, and they asked questions about accessibility and dealing with stakeholders and I did my best to answer. \n\nToday I got a message from the recruiter that they want someone with more experience, but this reason seems to be a generic rejection instead of why I really got rejected.\n\nI don‚Äôt think I have performed well, maybe it was the case studies I was presenting, maybe it was the way I answered the questions, I would really like to know how I can improve. I tried connecting with the interviewers after the interview but they are not accepting the invitations except for one. I really want this job since there are not that many companies in the area that I live in, it‚Äôs been really difficult to get a job. Even if I don‚Äôt have the job I would at least want to maintain a good relationship with the interviewers. At this point I don‚Äôt really know what I should do next.	16	5

So many good insights from across the industry.\n\nI recently got laid off due to an agency acquisition along with a dozen other people. I‚Äôd been there nine years, worked my way up from freelance designer to director of XD, albeit I was basically a UX team of one for the past four years. For reference, I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs and been doing UX work since 2007, along with some project management. I‚Äôve been designing and making websites since the late 90‚Äôs.\n\nIn my early days there I worked as an embedded designer with a large national insurance corp, doing interface design, customer web apps, asp.net agent platforms, and quote-centric web tools. As we evolved we focused mostly on websites, content hubs, content production, etc. I really like the latter; it‚Äôs a bit more stimulating intellectually as someone with an advertising degree and love of all things web. \n\nI‚Äôve been going over the skill set I‚Äôm armed with, as well as the skills I worry about not having. For starters, the things I haven‚Äôt done much of:\n\n- Large scale research. Most web projects were either with clients who had a lot of research to offer, along with personas and audience info, or, were intuitive enough for us to strategize for with little effort. Research has never been my focus; it‚Äôs been much focus on design.\n- People management. I‚Äôve never had direct reports, which I think is expected by the time you‚Äôre at a director level. I have mentored and guided junior designers on our creative teams, and helped lead multidisciplinary teams.\n\nKey skills / experience I do have in my skill set:\n\n- Web background. I‚Äôve been making sites since the days of Geocities and before CSS or responsive design was a thing. I‚Äôm highly familiar and knowledgeable of front and back end design, CMS development and management, skilled at all things Wordpress, slowly becoming an expert with Oxygen Builder in WP, and much more. I can code decently, learning more about JavaScript for fun lately.\n- Design tools. Switched to Figma last year when Adobe XD was destined for the scrap heap. Helped creative team designers learn XD and adopt a collaborative design process that Adobe or Sketch didn‚Äôt offer until then. I‚Äôve also used Axure extensively but it‚Äôs been several years.\n- Working with creative and development. I‚Äôve always prided myself on being a lynchpin between these two disciplines. I‚Äôm great at working with both, guiding either based on the needs or constraints of the other. \n- Embracing ambiguity. There‚Äôs nothing I love more than to start a project that‚Äôs confusing, open ended, and that I know nothing about. I‚Äôve been recognized by colleagues for this and how I‚Äôm always ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù who digs in and figures out confusing stuff.\n- Pitch work. Love working with leadership on new business opportunities, quick concepting and prototyping to win new work. Helped us win quite a few projects, always satisfying.\n- Typical UX deliverables. Low - high fidelity wires, site maps, user flows, as well as functional annotations and project requirements.\n\nLastly, a lot of what I did was very content-centric, helping our teams design better content, making it more visually driven, exploring scrollytelling where it made sense, trying to make blog content and evergreen content more memorable and effective. That‚Äôs where the web designer in me feels very comfortable and has a lot of fun. \n\nSo I sit here typing this as I‚Äôm about to go apply for a few jobs today and continue working on my portfolio, wondering‚Ä¶ what should I be pursuing? \n\nI worry that my experience at director level where I was might not translate to director level elsewhere. I‚Äôd been trying to focus more on the XD strategy side of things at the advice of my boss, realizing that might move me away a bit from the hands on nature of designing things from beginning to end. At the same time, I do feel like I‚Äôve had a pretty interesting career so far and I‚Äôve got a lot of versatility and broad experience that can be valuable in the right place and role. \n\nI do indeed think about freelancing and consulting on my own, particularly focused on content design and strategy. I like the idea of helping teams and businesses transform the stories they tell, shunning text-based content that few people read and making content more impactful. \n\nDecisions, decisions‚Ä¶ I need to get back to working soon but glad I have some time to think through it.\n\nAny thoughts or insights you have, particularly from others at this level, I would be most appreciative. Thanks in advance.	11	21

I've been working as a UX designer for 10 years now and it's not fulfilling to me anymore. I got into tech because I like making things, studied CS, and have been working as a UX designer since graduating from college. TBH, I don't think a lot of the work UX designers do ends up being valuable. Whether that is because of the work UX does or because of organizations is up for debate, but that's where I'm at.

I hope the situation is better for you.\n\nI‚Äôve realized that more often than not, a design job is just about pixel moving. In my 12 years working with different companies, only 1 offered any support to speak to users. Even there the feedback was completely disregarded, and was just a means to push a useless feature.\n\nMost companies didn‚Äôt even have design awareness. A couple needed Hi-Fi designs to even brainstorm. My team got the requirements and we directly jumped into Hi-Fi. They iterate on it for weeks  on end based on continuous feedback. I cannot tell you what a pain it is when some stupid stakeholder raises a stink after you designed over a 100 screens in excruciating detail, prompting you to make a change across all of those screens. \n\nNobody other than peers would tell a programmer how to do their job, because others don‚Äôt understand code. But just because people can see designs, they have all sorts of feedback. I‚Äôve come to hate the phrase ‚ÄúTry something innovative‚Äù. What the hell is that? And what about all the damn innovation that has already gone into these designs? Just doesn‚Äôt matter. \n\nI‚Äôve repeatedly read on this sub on similar posts - ‚Äúyou‚Äôre working with a bad company‚Äù. Sadly I don‚Äôt know where the good ones even are! I would‚Äôve enjoyed working on maybe 2% of the projects I‚Äôve touched. I love design and the process of solutioning. But the reality has been very different. I‚Äôm just fed up of being a pixel monkey. \n\n	103	245

I have worked on enterprise web applications and due to timelines and scenarios related to availability of users, I tried my best to follow the design process. I now realize I was a pixel pusher for 40% of the time and there are 2-3 projects I worked from the scratch where I followed the end to end design process (User research, journey mapping, IA, wireframing, prototyping and usability testing). I'm compiling my work as I want to make  a switch and I'm having a reality check on the quality and quantity of my work. The projects did solve user issues and have received a positive feedback from them verbally.   \nI'm going thorough other's work online and I feel I have no chance at all. I feel like I just have 2-3 years of experience and with cut throat competition out there, I am feeling hopeless. I have testimonials shared by my manager and I am appreciated for my work and my commitment but they have also mentioned that I can try to be more creative, risk taking, questioning the status quo etc.   \nI am not proud of my work, honestly when I see work of other folks.   \nI am 30 years old and I sometimes feel the work of 22-24 year old folks has so much depth, better visuals, better story telling and impactful work.  \nI have reworked on my projects probably 3 times by improving the UI but there is not much I can do due to project context and scope.

This was my baseline. It worked a few years ago. Would it work now? No. Nearly all got rejected within a few days. To me, this meant that I was getting immediately declined, so I contacted a recruiter to review my resume. The recruiter said that I needed to start tailoring my resume to the job posting. I also contacted a designer to review my portfolio‚Äîthe one that worked years ago. The content was good but needed a visual update.\n\nFor Batch 2, I visually updated my portfolio and tailored my resume so that every bullet point corresponded to keywords and lines in the job postings. My portfolio saw a few visits for the first time. Rejections came, but they came a lot slower, so maybe my applications got a little more attention.\n\nFor Batch 3, I started to think that my keyword usage was overkill after reading and listening to posts from Amy Miller, a recruiter I follow on LinkedIn. She said to focus less on keywords and more on context, because a lot of these ‚Äúkeywords‚Äù are haphazardly determined by the ATS and therefore not reliable. Focus more on what makes your experience valuable and interesting rather than stress and guess on which words are the keywords. With that said, you can still reasonably guess that the very first qualification and responsibility mentioned on the job posting are the most important items the hiring team is looking for. I applied these tips to my resume, got more portfolio visits, got some slow rejections, but finally got a few invitations to meet a recruiter.\n\nCurrently I am on Batch 4, which used a similar approach to Batch 3, except I tried a new layout for my resume. So far, I am still seeing consistent portfolio visits but no new invitations to interview.\n\nA few more details about my overall job search:\n- I only apply to positions if I have the most relevant experience. If I read ‚Äú_____ experience preferred‚Äù or ‚Äúfamiliarity with _____‚Äù and I can‚Äôt offer that, then I won‚Äôt bother competing with those who can.\n- I try to apply within 1-2 days of when the job was posted. I don‚Äôt apply to the jobs that get reposted on LinkedIn or are older than 30 days unless someone from the company explicitly says that they‚Äôre still looking.\n- I highly recommend following Amy Miller on LinkedIn and YouTube to get an inside look at how recruiters do their job.\n- Last week someone posted [their approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/s/uLve4Omjvs), and it‚Äôs similar to mine.	10	63

Since I‚Äôve been there, my biggest complaint is that I don‚Äôt have enough work to do. I‚Äôve done everything I can to try and combat the problem. I‚Äôve been vocal about it and I‚Äôve created projects myself that I saw a need for (I am just finishing up a huge two-year project that‚Äôs making a big impact on the business that I‚Äôm really proud of). Somehow even with little to do, the projects I‚Äôve made have had high-visibility and I‚Äôve really earned the respect of my team and I‚Äôll be getting promoted to a senior level in a few months. I also want to add that I really like my coworkers. \n\nHowever, I am so bored and feel like I‚Äôm not growing. I just got a new manager who said he‚Äôll bring me in on some more projects but I feel like I‚Äôm just sitting around waiting. \n\nOn the other hand, I made it to the final round interview for another job and I‚Äôm completely on the fence if I‚Äôd take it or not. It‚Äôs another mid-level job but the design team is smaller (9 people vs 25 where I‚Äôm at). I really like the hiring manager and she seems like she‚Äôd help with career growth. The pay is a lot more, but I know if I got an offer I could leverage it for a raise at my current job (please no input on this ‚Äî I‚Äôve talked to coworkers who have done this and it goes over well at my company). \n\nAnyway, in my career I‚Äôve only changed jobs because I hated my current job. This situation is tougher for me and I‚Äôm not sure if I should wait for my promotion and only change jobs if a dream job comes along. \n	23	17

In theory, there should be no clicking at all, though I am fine with clicking from one text input field to another when switching from scanning the card to scanning the books. \n\nI don't understand why all these software devs feel the need to add a bunch of extra steps to a simple process. For example, on one software I've tested, I would have to first click: ""search patron"", then scan their card, then after scanning click ""search"", then click the patrons name, then click ""confirm"", then I'd have to click ""add new book"" (its the only clickable option other than 'back'), then I'd have to select the search box. I'd get to scan one book before clicking ""submit"". If the patron wants to check out more than one book, I have to then go back to ""add new book."" \n\nHow did these horrible softwares make it past development?

The desks are very small and close together. There's really only space for one monitor per desk, and if 2 people near each other are on a call, background noise is a major issue.\n\nWe have a variety of rooms with tvs where you can plug in your monitor. But then you are at a table with an uncomfortable chair, no mouse or keyboard, and a big tv far away instead of computer monitors. Hooking up to the tv is awkward. If you don't do it all the time, it's easy to forget how to get it working right.\n\nTaking a meeting is a constant problem. Moving around and using different equipment is stressful and distracting when I'm trying to walk a client through a lot of details, and get answers. It also causes a lot of eye strain and back pain after an hour on a bad chair stairing at the tv. So I stubbornly stay at my desk with everything the way I need it. I'm also considering working from home more to avoid the noise problems during important meetings.\n\nPreviously, I worked in a more traditional office with giant cubicles, each with 2 big monitors and a docking station. You rarely needed to move, but if you ever did need to move for noise issues, it was super easy to dock into a different cubicle.\n\nI've seen other open offices, but the desks or tables are very large and spaced out so theres room for multiple monitors, and less noise interference.\n\nWhenever this issue comes up in conversation, I feel like I'm the office diva, but until this job, I never had to even think about these things, they were non-issues!\n\n\------------\n\nSo, what is normal for you? How do you take meetings, is it a problem?\n\n&#x200B;	10	7

I'm particularly interested in which ""paradigms"" or ""principles"" have changed so fundamentally that we should ""unlearn"" existing patterns.\n\nOne example, which comes more from marketing theory, is the separation between B2B and B2C business relationships and their manifestation on the web. Due to organisational separations, there used to be separated B2B and B2C websites; our customers tried to create ""order"" by making a clear allocation to one of both groups as early as possible in the process. In reality, however, things look different: B2C (end) customers are often well informed, researching in ""professional"" sources; on the other hand, B2B customers also move around in social media environments and want to be inspired ‚Äî even in their free time. This suggests making them ""joint"" offers that differentiate as far as possible in the customer journey, leading to new challenges in UX-design (This is just an example ‚Äî i don't want to discuss this particular issue..)\n\n**What examples can you think of?

However, in interviews, it can be tricky. I'm not even talking about ""huge"" differences, but mostly ""behaviours"" or ""stereotypes"" that some people assume from a certain culture.\n\nIn my case, coming from the South, I'm accustomed to being outspoken, less direct, energetic and easygoing - at least that was what my colleagues told me in peer reviews lol.\n\nBut recently, I had an interview with a German company, and immediately upon entering the meeting, I sensed they didn't like me because I was too expressive.\n\nFor example, I answered a question, but they didn't feel it was answered as they liked, so they immediately replied, ""I'm going to ask again, do you want to do X or Y?""\n\nIn my culture, If it was me in his situation I would assume the person didn't understand the question and that it was my fault, so I would say, ""Sorry, maybe I didn't explain well. Are you interested in X or Y?""\n\nTo me, their response felt hostile, being so direct and dry. However, I believe they didn't mean to be rude, but I perceived them as such.\n\nUnfortunately, this caused problems as I didn't pass the first phase, which is rare in my experience as I've done many interviews and I always pass 1st stage. The feedback was that I struggled to communicate and even went off-topic.\n\nWhen I do interviews with the USA companies is the opposite, ""You really know what you are talking about, very high energy and know how to communicate etc..""\n\nHow do you deal with this in an interview? Do you try to stay as neutral as possible? I try my best to read the room, but I also don't want to work in a company where I can't be myself, so I take the risk, to be honest.\n\nP.S.: Btw this was an example not mean to offend anyone, but I had multiple interviews there and had the same with similar feedback from companies in that region."	10	3

Looks like you can only do it with a plugin or hacking using your chrome browser and the inspection tool.\n\nAlas what has annoyed me is the Head of User Research has done the following :\n\n* Hi \[name\] how are you settling in?\n* Love that your in our retail chat, but can you Google things before asking questions?\n* i.e. QQ : does anyone know how to download Zoom recordings to \[our local banking environment\]?  \n\n\nI find this to be really unhelpful because :\n\n* I'm facing a not so simple issue to fix, sounds simple I know but it shouldn't\n* I'm using my initiative to be a ""team"" or ""collaborate.""\n* This may surprise people but I did actually ""google"" how to download recordings on YouTube too.\n* I have 14 years of experience and being told to ""google it"" I find is unhelpful, unprofessional, and all-round awful leadership.\n* You can even be new to UX, and you'd be put off with ""google it.""\n\n  \nAnyway, it was gone 5pm when they sent it.

To be frank, I don't have a substantial portfolio to show for it. My coursework was primarily a PowerPoint presentation, and despite using it, I haven‚Äôt secured a single interview. The course focused a lot on UX history and lacked practical applications.\n\nI am a multimedia designer 9yo exp eager to transition into product design. In my last position, I applied what I learned from my certification to redesign our website, but I didn't have the chance to work with a UX team. I've been looking for volunteer opportunities to build my portfolio, but without tangible design work to showcase, it's been challenging to find someone willing to take a chance on me.\n\nGiven that I was recently laid off, I‚Äôm contemplating investing my savings into another program that is recognized by employers and can help me build a solid portfolio in both Canada and the US. I‚Äôm neurodivergent, so I‚Äôm seeking programs that are less than six months long, as that‚Äôs the timeframe I can fully commit to.\n	16	5

Many of these have grown to quite substantial sizes and have ever expanded their suite of functionality. The more functionality the platform has the more important the UX becomes. However, I've experienced that most of the time, as the complexity always increases and the web UI lags and UX suffers...  \n\n\nTo anybody who works at any of those big SaaS providers (i.e. Salesforce, BambooHR, Adobe etc.) or has some other related experience - I am curious to hear what you think on the following:  \n\n\n1. Do users struggle to discriminate between two similarily looking workflows? (i.e. In Salesforce, the workflows for converting a lead into an opportunity and directly creating an opportunity are quite similar)\n2. Do users struggle to discover relevant workflows, becasue it was buried in a maze of other options? (i.e. I find Email-to-Case Automation quite useful in Salesforce but many of people I talk to don't know about it.)\n3. How often does it happen that a user fails to discover a relevant workflow? Does you company track those events and then tries to prevent them with UI improvements? \n4. How do you deal with feature discoverability by users? I imagine users may use your platform for workflow A without ever discovering that it can also help with workflow B, that they do manually atm. Do you track some metrics on this?\n\nThanks!	2	4

The single version will be different from those in the list as it has a bolder layout and more metadata, like ingress or author.\n\nA idea was pitched to call the single version Tease Hero and the list of 2‚Äì4 a Teaser Collection. The underlying concept being that all things meant to stand alone and be attention grabbing are Heros and secondary versions of the same content are sidekicks, so you could have a Button Hero, an Accordion Hero, a Contact Card Hero etc, so you would probably prefer to use Hero items for your CTAs.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Would this naming convention makes sense, is it a valid naming scheme, are there better naming schemes, how does your system name things that can occur in multiple sizes/values/focus grabbing attention?"	4	0

On the call I presented my  first project then when I was going to present the second one the  interviewer said that my first project was enough for them, and I can  send them my presentation, which I didn't do, because I was hesitant  sharing my script. We just chatted until the end, mostly about team  working stuff. I was quite confident about this interview, but I was  rejected. In feedback, they have written that they are looking for  somebody with more experience in UX methodologies, processes, and  research. I believe the other, not presented (but available in my  portfolio) project shows more UX methods. My question is, should I  respond to feedback email attaching my presentation and asking if they  would like to reconsider my candidacy after reading my presentation? I  don't want to make them angry in case of a new recruitment in the  future. And question to recruitment managers, did you ever change your  mind after rejecting somebody?	8	9

We also need a plug and play solution - we don't have the staf to build out own. Can anyone recomment a platform that might work for all of this? And any vagur isuea of cost? Are we looking at thousands per year, or tens of thousands, for example?\n\nThanks so much - really would appreciate any insights.	11	1

If you want to make your portfolio presentation in figma and present it as slides that‚Äôs fine. But moving around in a messy figma file full of screens is hard for interviewers to follow, especially when accompanied with stream of consciousness. It also shows a poor ability to tell a story and present, 2 key components of influencing and UX design. \nTake the time to put together a deck with a couple of slides about you, and then 2-3 detailed projects that include info on what YOU did, how YOU influenced the project, challenges, how you over came them, and data and outcomes. \n\nAlso, for the rest of the interview, know how to answer situational questions (the STAR method) because many companies use these now, and know how to do a whiteboarding exercise. \n\nIt‚Äôs unsettling how many interviews in the past month I have ended 15 minutes in because candidates aren‚Äôt presenting.

To provide some context, I hold a degree in Frontend Development, but my professional journey took a little turn when I transitioned into UX Design for my first job about a year ago.\n\nOver this past year, I've delved deep into the world of UX design and found a genuine passion for it. However, I can't shake the feeling that my background in Frontend Development could be both a blessing and a curse in my pursuit of a career in UX Design. I'm now on the job hunt because like everyone else I was laid off due to budget cuts.\n\nMy main question is: Are UX designers with an understanding of Frontend development sought after in the job market? And if so, how should I effectively communicate my hybrid skill set in job applications and interviews?\n\nI don't have recent Frontend-specific projects to showcase, most of my work the last year has been UX related. I've remained familiar with Frontend development, possess the necessary skills, and have provided support to Frontend developers in my role as a UX Designer.

So as a way to offer this community some hope, I wanted to share my experience searching for and landing a job in the current market.\n\nFor context: I'm a Senior designer in the U.S. that's spent the past 5 years at a small, but established agency. For my next role, I wanted to step away from an agency setting and land something in-house and remote.\n\nI spent the last 2 months of '23 designing and building my portfolio in Framer, tailoring my resume, and getting feedback before I sent out my first application in January.\n\nFor the first \~40 days, I was essentially shouting into the void; networking, sending out applications with customized resumes and cover letters - all to get absolutely nothing in return. I mean, it was nice meeting folks while networking, but it wasn't fruitful in finding a local job that was also remote.\n\nIt became clear that I needed to adjust my strategy, so here's what I did:\n\n* I started looking for jobs to apply to twice a day: first thing in the morning, and late afternoon. This increased my chances of finding \*fresh\* job posts and getting my application in ASAP.\n* I focused my efforts on mid-size companies located in Eastern or Central time zones. Granted there are less of them, but I did this for 2.5 reasons:\n\n1. Large/FAANG companies out West receive the greatest amount of applications 1.5) I've worked with large clients over the years and they were consistently the *worrrst* to deal with\n2. I noticed a lot of applications coming in from the West coast so I opted to use my location (shoutout CLE) as a way to gain leverage with opportunities in my time zone.\n\n* The most robust projects in my portfolio are SaaS products, so I zeroed in on those opportunities to better leverage my skillset.\n\nThese changes made all difference and I landed 4 interviews in quick succession. From there, I jumped through the typical hoops (screener, multiple rounds of interviews and working sessions) and received an offer that I happily accepted.\n\nIn summary: I really just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get down on yourself during this process. Keep trying. If what you're doing isn't working, try approaching it from a slightly different angle and see what changes picks up traction. I've included a chart detailing some more data points, but I'm happy to answer any questions or offer some advice. You've got this!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ydy4g7tq8wtc1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=ade813fb9020793997ddae300ac98f363ad4f1a0\n\n	48	141

However, I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a common term for identifying the most complex, repeated parts of a product that are well beyond UI components or design system scope. They tend to have their own UX flows, but not necessarily Pages. Common example would be Login, but that‚Äôs usually a page. So, Sharing, Access Controls, or document creation. IE, well established flows, patterns, and a combo of UI that recurs in the app, which designers don‚Äôt need to reinvent \n	6	1

My FitBit recorded it all, and there's a timeline of it in the screen shots below.\n\nNow to the UX messaging part.\n\nDuring this, my FitBit congratulated me multiple times about how I was ""in the zone"" and doing a great job!   I found it pretty amusing during the event, however also a good lesson about UX.\n\nI'm sure one has to be really careful about messaging health-related things, but in this case it kind of backfired.  Totally safe to tell someone ""good job you must be exercising!"" Not so safe to do so if they aren't.  It knew I wasn't running a marathon as my steps weren't going up, and it knew I was basically inactive in general.   \n\nHonestly I'm not sure how one would handle this if one specifically did not want to move into the realm of medical advice.  You can't just say, ""Look I'm just a watch, but your heart seems kind of fast and you're not moving much.  I'm not here to give you advice, but you might want to google 'tachycardia'""\n\nPS\n\nI did go to the ER, and it was Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).  They had to do a ""chemical cardioversion"" to fix it.  This essentially stopped my heart for about 6 seconds - the equivalent of ""Have you tried turning it off and then back on again?""  I also ordered an Apple Watch which can and will alert you to irregular heartbeats.\n\nPPS\n\nI have a Versa 2 FitBit that's a few years old.  There are probably newer models that can effectively notify the user.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5yc7z39kotc1.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=c15f5ac04426780e8cbae6ce502e73498b782273\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bxoo5ahbkotc1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=474a8d28f01cadd7406d20d6f442ca9e72bf49a1\n\n"	4	9

One of our more senior designers never demos their work with the team until very final hi-fi stages of the design. It's so frustrating. The rest of the team is very good at showing work at all stages of the process. Their justification is that ""the designs are probably going to change, so there's no point in getting feedback"", but it feels like they don't respect anyone's opinion. It's also hard to get a sense of what is going on with other squads with this sort of mentality until it's too late.\n\nAnyone else deal with this? Is there some other justification for never showing work?\n\nEDIT:  \nUpdating with a comment I left on a previous thread: Since we all work on different parts of the same product patterns can sometimes change without having a lot of context to why or how they are affecting other teams. So yeah it affects my work often. It creates a very siloed team"	36	27

In typical startup fashion, everything is a mess; but that's another story. One of the first things I wanted to change was the use of RED for everything.\n\nThe logo is a deeply saturated red, which is fine, but they used this red for every button, link, and action on their dashboard/web app. It's abrasive and makes everything look like an error or a warning. \n\nI am trying to transition them to new colors for primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons, actions, and links, but I'm struggling - color isn't my area of expertise (i'd prefer everything be black and white most of the time). We're using the Material UI kit, but I also don't love the default colors in their design system. I changed the Primary Blue to a bit darker because of contrast issues on the white background. \n\nAs I'm building out the design system, I would love to implement a solid color palette that compliments the logo, gives us a unique feel, and will be great for a long time. What advice can you give me on colors across the web app?	3	0

I  was brought into the project a couple years into its development, and requirements were never fully done. Most of the products (web applications)  were already in production when I joined, but they only had one pilot group that was using them. Feedback was not great from the get go and I feel like everyone on the team has been throwing spaghetti at the wall coming up with quick fixes ever since. I have to constantly advocate to include UX research in their decisions. A couple stakeholders understand and are more supportive of the UX process, but feedback and suggested designs often get shut down due other project priorities...although the priorities are rarely communicated.  I‚Äôve learned how to choose my battles as I go along. Project management and leadership don‚Äôt see eye to eye and I am recognizing this is an overall a failing project which just happens to be budgeted for at least two more years. If this was industry, it would have been toast already.  In my opinion, and based on research and feedback, management is making terrible decisions on next steps right now, adding in all sorts of extra data security measures that absolutely no user is used to using anywhere else.  It‚Äôs hard to sit back and watch management make these decisions, but I can‚Äôt fight how the team operates and recognize that maybe I don‚Äôt have all of the information about why certain decisions are being made. It‚Äôs a lot of setting aside any ideals of how the UX process should work and also setting aside my ego. \n\nI guess I just need to vent, although I am open to any advice.  I am currently getting my masters in HCI and UX Design and hoping my degree opens up other job opportunities. And I am using this job as a way to build my portfolio and just learn a lot. Encouragement would be appreciated.  \n\n	7	7

This tool will provide a comprehensive platform for exploring diverse career paths, including assessments for guidance. While considering integrating LLM, my primary focus is on seeking inspiration beyond conventional methods.\n\nMy goal is to avoid mundane designs and repetitive content. While I've found inspiration from platforms like AirBNB and Duolingo, I'm eager to explore alternative sources.\n\nThe objective is to categorize careers based on Career and Technical Education (CTE) clusters outlined by [https://careertech.org/what-we-do/career-clusters/](https://careertech.org/what-we-do/career-clusters/). These clusters, consisting of 12 categories, allow for drilling down into specific career paths, such as medical &gt; diagnostic &gt; MRI technologist (3 levels).\n\nI'm intent on deviating from typical dashboard layouts due to the lack of unique content control. Project managers have requested a tangible product for testing, hence the need for a distinctive approach to engage students while soliciting feedback.\n\nOne unexplored idea involves a game-like character configurator akin to Baldur's Gate or Cyberpunk. Users would begin by selecting a ""team"" (e.g., medical), then zoom in to choose a character based on profession. Contextual information would accompany each selection, possibly utilizing face transfer stable diffusion for the user to change its face and seeing him/herself into the tool.   \n\n\nThe UI would predominantly feature characters against isolated backgrounds, akin to contemporary gaming interfaces. I'm open to feedback on the viability of this concept, especially if executed with premium 3D characters, is this silly?\n\nI also considered utilizing a fictional map resembling a Disney park layout, but initial attempts sucked - too much complexity\n\nI welcome any fresh perspectives or insights as I continue to explore various development approaches."	2	0

I have noticed that stakeholder meetings, marketing decisions, consultation, etc. all are not for me and I hate everything about them.\n\nA little background info: I studied UX design and since graduating two years ago have been working as a UX designer in a rather big and reputable agency. I solely do UX work there, we have a separate department for UI. I liked studying UX and am still passionate about good UX, clever ideas and implementation, design research and heuristics, and finding good solutions to big problems.\n\nHowever, I have found myself extremely demotivated in the past months to even get up and go to work. It seems that my days only consist of meetings, company politics, selling UX work, juggling stakeholder demands, opinion wars, and so on. The actual design work is more of a side issue and does not take the focus even in meetings and collaboration. I know nobody really likes these things, but I get the feeling my personality (being a shy introvert) is just not cut out for this and it also affects my quality of work.\n\nI know that I can learn to become better at these things, but I honestly don't even want to. I feel like having to defend my designs in constant opinion wars really gets to me and triggers some sort of imposter syndrome ‚Äì¬†or maybe I just am a bad designer and don't like that this is being shoved in my face daily. People around me are becoming senior designers and when I see the job they are doing it makes me dread taking that step one day... All they do is strategy and politics.\n\nAll of this led to my confidence being at an all time low which makes me feel even less equipped to do my job right and discuss my designs confidently. It makes me think I am just not cut out for this and will not be happy with UX as my career. Recently I have been thinking about switching to the UI department. In my imagination this would mean less consultation and strategy, and more actual design work with visuals and tangible elements.\n\nWhat is your opinion on this? Do any of you feel the same? Did any of you make that switch? I am so unsure about where to go from here, so any advice is appreciated.	25	27

Nowadays everyone, including YouTube, are trying to add short form of content on their platforms.\n\nChatGPT has created a huge impact on technology itself, now everyone is trying to add AI on everything. \n\nNetflix has redefined entertainment industry, people's behavior has changed, they don't want cable anymore, completely abolished DVD renting services, people are less interested to go to theaters, and almost every production house is trying to create their own Netflix. \n\nIn UI Design, Figma has redefined how designers work, and the flat design style has redefined how designers approach UI design. \n\nThese are innovative, revolutionary, and have redefined an industry. \n\n\nI think we should stop putting some rectangle and oval shape on a larger rectangle and call it revolutionary product that has redefined the industry. \n\nNot all products are revolutionary and that's okay, I want my chair to be comfortable to sit on, not to revolutionize how we sit on chair. \n\n\n	11	38

Or when I have multiple designs collaborating on similar elements. What I have found that if I wait too long to start developing a design system, it never gets completed and I have a lot of design debt to catch up on as I get moved on to another project. 	6	0

That makes sense for where we are now with this tech, but is that going to be it's ultimate form? It seems to me that a blank text box might be fairly intimidating for someone -- are there interesting affordances that are starting to get put into place to help people craft prompts? Is ""chatbot"" how people are going to *want* to interact with this information?\n\nI realize this is a fairly open ended question, but it feels like a pretty open landscape, as these are brand new interaction patterns. I'm curious what people are seeing in terms of how everyone is starting to experiment with implementing this into products. Anyone have examples of someone doing something out of the box?

(Automod and Reddit admin continued to do their robot jobs.) Now that experiment is over, and now we're asking for your feedback.\n\nAnalytics data shows that there were more posts published, and somewhat fewer posts removed. (I do not know why this data only goes to April 5 when it's currently April 7, but this is what I have access to.)\n\n[Published and removed posts over the previous 7 days. 182 posts published, up 67 from the previous 7 days. 100 posts removed, down 22 from the previous 7 days.](https://preview.redd.it/ybhp9ez9f6tc1.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd79ca318c35151d6c659b7b106a3fecc4c57f45)\n\n**Current rules will be enforced again**\n\nWe've learned a lot from the past week, and plan to make changes based on what we've learned and your feedback. For right now, we're going to go back to moderating the way we did before. That means entry-level questions will be directed to the ""Breaking into UX"" sticky and portfolio/case study reviews and discussion will be directed to the other sticky. (We can only have two stickies.)\n\n**Feedback welcome about the sub**\n\nWe're interested to know how your experience with the sub was different over the past week ‚Äî what types of posts did you see more of that you'd like to see more of, or posts you really don't want to see on the sub?\n\nThe overall mission of the sub won't change ‚Äî our target audience is people with at least a couple of years experience/at least a couple of jobs working in UX, not people who are new to the field.\n\n**Feedback welcome about new features we've enabled**\n\nBoth chat and polls were enabled this week. Chat seems to have gotten some engagement, especially among more junior folks. Maybe chat (in addition to the stickies) is a way to redirect entry-level discussion so we can keep the main feed focused on questions from more experienced UX practitioners.\n\n**Plans to improve the flair**\n\nI have wanted to rearchitect the post flair for a while, and this experiment with leaving the sub unmoderated for a week is an input to that. I have scraped the sub to get the most recent 1000 posts (thanks to my business partner and genuinely good dude u/eaton) and am working on encoding the posts. Having a week's worth of unmoderated data is valuable for this information architecture exercise.\n\nMy encoding is freeform right now, and won't necessarily translate exactly to the new post flair/labels, but some new categories I've come up with so far:\n\n* Job search & hiring\n* Relationships with bosses/coworkers\n* Feelings about the future of UX\n* Feedback request \n* Examples and inspiration\n* How do I get better at‚Ä¶\n\nIf anyone wants to do some encoding to provide another set of eyes on it, let me know and I will share my giant spreadsheet. I am also thinking about ways to use an LLM to review a larger corpus of posts based on the current and new encoding.\n\n**Plans to improve the rules and automod**\n\nOnce we have thought through the changes needed to the sub, we'll update the rules as well as the automod comments and removals. While we'd love it if everyone who posted read the rules, we know that's not realistic. The rules exist so that we have something to point to that explains why mods make the choices we do, with corresponding reporting reasons and removal reasons. Our goal is to moderate in a way that stays true to the intent of the sub ‚Äî to provide a place for experienced people to talk about what they do at their job ‚Äî and also to minimize the amount of pushback we get in modmail or on the main feed."	29	29

Need some advice from you my fellow experienced designers!\n\n# Some background\n\n* Went to private art classes since I was kid, have a good understanding of colour theory and compositions\n* Initially pursued design but realized its hard to make money (this is before the iPhone era)\n* Graduated with Business Marketing Degree and Fine Arts certificate\n* Did some side gigs in digital arts, skilled in Photoshop and illustrator\n* Took some random courses on coding, skilled in with HTML and CSS\n* Worked in retail and finance for a long time, managing people and handling investments and loans\n* Switched career in late 20s, went to bootcamp for UX\n* Worked at some start ups and charity places before landing at this current public sector job. Didn‚Äôt like the marketing agencies as they don‚Äôt really care about UX and just want to pump out pretty designs every week\n\n# Current state\n\n* Living in Vancouver Canada, still renting\n* Turning 34 this year and I feel old and behind in terms of career and starting a family. Currently saving in hoping to purchase a place with girlfriend and get married\n* Intermediate UX designer at public sector job, very fortunate to find a design career in the public sector, I wanted to make a difference doing something I love\n* 10k debt from previous student loan\n\n# Why I want to leave my current job\n\n* Feel old and behind in terms of career, starting a family, and having my own place\n* Public pay is alright but still not enough compared to private sector jobs. Who doesn‚Äôt want a higher pay\n* Things are too slow in the public sector, projects don‚Äôt seem intriguing. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm learning much and I want to work on more interesting projects\n* Job hopping makes a difference, I know a few who are less talented but still able to jump higher pay and positions because of it\n\n# Where I want to be in the next 5 years\n\n* Senior designer or higher\n* Work on mobile apps, B2C or B2B products\n* Get married\n* Long term goal work at Apple, Microsoft, Google etc.. Yes I like to dream big and thats how I got to where I am today\n\n# Potential opportunities\n\n**Option 1: Switch to private sector**\n\nI think this option makes the most sense for higher pay and experience, especially if I can‚Äôt or no need to get enough further education\n\nPros¬†\n\n* Higher pay, move to higher positions faster, work on more interesting projects and level my skillset further\n\nCons\n\n* No stability, somewhat matters due to my age and forthcoming wants such as getting married\n\n\_\n\n**Option 2: Go back to school for a degree or masters in design**\n\nWorking at public sector means work life balance, and I feel like I can manage work and school with this balance.\n\nProbably one of my biggest drawbacks is that I don‚Äôt have a degree or masters in design. Although my portfolio and skillset were able to get me to where I am today, it was a difficult journey as I was only able to demonstrate those after I got into the company.\n\n* Someone who has a design degree but performs worse gets promoted before me due to their background in design\n* I have to prove myself only when I have the right projects to demonstrate that and if I have the right audience to present to\n* Lacking a degree in design makes it harder for me to get through the HR door\n\nPros\n\n* Strengthen my resume\n\nCons\n\n* Brings no additional knowledge, more debt and might push my marriage further down the road\n\nBlockers\n\n* Honestly wouldn‚Äôt even consider spending another 40K on higher education, max 20k that I‚Äôm comfortable with\n* I don‚Äôt think I qualify for masters, I don‚Äôt have 3.0 GPA (2.8/2.9) as I know most of the schools I‚Äôve looked at the minimum entry to masters is 3.5 GPA with 1-2 schools accepting 3.0. And also mind that not all of them even offers online masters.\n\n\_\n\n**Option 3: Stay where I am and try to move up**\n\nHard to do so given the current structure of the team but not impossible. However, to give you a sense, even if I move up one level higher I‚Äôll be just hitting 100k annual. Im not saying this is not a lot of money but given my position and experience, I feel like I could be getting higher from the private sector\n\nPros\n\n* Stability\n\nCons\n\n* I don‚Äôt think this meets my goals in the long run. The longer I stay the more time I waste\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, happy to answer any. Really want some guidance on what to do onwards. I have been going back and forth on this and I don‚Äôt know what to do.\n\nThank you in advance designers!	15	5

It is a first round interview and I haven't been given much information other than this: \n\n'This first call is an informal chat to allow the team to understand more about your design experience. There will be an further interview if successful at this stage.' \n\nThe interview is with two design leads from the area I have applied for the role in. I did not have a recruiter screener call. I applied on the company's website directly and received an email a week or so later inviting me for the interview. \n\nDo you know what types of questions I might expect at this stage? Thanks so much in advance. I really want this job and want to do well. Thanks. \n\n	2	0

I need to use these illustration assets (dog, lawn mower, etc), but I'm having trouble incorporating color. In greyscale I feel like they give a web comic vibe, but when I try adding color they look a little flat? I would love any advice on how I could incorporate color to bring some life to the site. There's no constraints with the color palette, this is just what I'm experimenting with atm. Thanks!!

I was only given access to a staged web app for solo testing and studying the existing user flow.\n\nI don't want to be in this position again in the future; I want to involve users and I want to use actual insights to determine where to focus our energy. However, I don't want to use my own money for a subscription for testing tools and was not sure how to target similar users for interviews.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. What would you have done in this situation?\n2. Does product testing with *anyone* still give valid insights, regardless of them being outside of the target audience?\n3. Is this a common situation working for a smaller company, and how do I explain this in interviews?	19	21

UXDesign	2024-04-06 23:27:30		trashpanda109		UX Design		Things to try if you‚Äôre on a job search	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bxphqw/things_to_try_if_youre_on_a_job_search/	Hi everyone, I am noticing a lot of posts about people having difficulty landing interviews and getting a job. \n\nI was laid off in August 2023, and wanted to share the things that I did and tried that helped me land a few jobs. \n\nThe first thing is that if all you‚Äôre doing is submitting applications on job posts, you‚Äôre not likely to get far. \n\nHere‚Äôs what to do: \n\n1) Read the two hour job search book. Through this method you‚Äôll be growing your network constantly. Aim to have a few calls per week with designers, design managers, or other folks  one to two levels senior in design. \n\n* don‚Äôt skip this step because it tells you how to get in touch with people for free and how to speak with them \n\nNot sponsored, if you find a free pdf online or summary go for it \n\n2) Be the first to respond to any post about a job. This means a user generated post on LinkedIn. Search for ‚Äúproduct design‚Äù + ‚Äúhiring‚Äù and choose ‚Äúposts‚Äù not ‚Äújobs‚Äù on the results filter. Do this every day, filter by date posted, and message every poster directly. You are much more likely to have your profile or message viewed and be considered when you‚Äôre first in the door, versus when you are the 1000th person to apply.\n\n3) find actively hiring managers for your role. Search ‚Äúdesign‚Äù + ‚Äúmanager‚Äù or some other position, and use the ‚Äúactively hiring‚Äù filter on LinkedIn. This way you can message managers directly about positions that may not be publicly shared. I got a job this way. \n\n4) I just gave you lots of tips on how to find people to message about jobs. What you say is important - don‚Äôt just say you‚Äôre interested and how many years experience you have. \n\nYour outreach about a job will be dependent on the achievements and skills that you have as an individual. My number one tip is to use hard data points such as:\n\n‚ÄúHey (person), I saw your post about your team at (company) hiring. I recently did (position) at (company) where I increased (metric) by (percentage) in a span of 3 months. I wonder if there‚Äôs a potential fit here - would you be open to chatting with me?‚Äù \n\nAnd keep it short! About as long as that and the shorter the better. \n\nThis is all just more granular ways to do networking but I found it really helped me. When this gets tiresome, switch over to working on your portfolio and interviewing skills. The work on your portfolio is never truly done. \n \n	11	49

I don't know what I'm doing wrong though to not even get in the door. Makes me think something is wrong with me as a designer but I know my stuff isn't garbage.

This site here (reddit)? 14px. Wikipedia? 14px.\n\nAmazon fares a bit better...using 16px in spots...though dipping down to 14px quite a bit for large blocks of text. Apple is also a bit all over the place, using 17px in a lot of their marketing pages, but also dipping below 16px in other areas quite a bit. \n\nI'm pushing for 16px on a redesign of our data-heavy UI which is, admittedly, a huge shift from what the team is used to. And there are some (perhaps valid) arguments that it's 'too big' given the data density we're working with.\n\nI guess I'm not even sure what my question is, as I think I know the answer as to why 16px isn't the norm...it's because most people look at it and go ""that looks too big"".\n\nBut why hasn't the 16px ""standard"" recommendation by so many accessibility and usability sources been more broadly adopted by us as an industry? Too many stubborn art directors?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"	27	17

It‚Äôs been re-invented many ways by different authorities, but you know typically follows a sort of Research, Define, Discover, Design, Iterate, Build type framework. \n\nLately, however, I sense a shift in designers renouncing formal processes as inhibiting creativity and divergent thinking by adding guardrails to brainstorming. Even in my own team there is a push in the spirit of innovation to generate as many big ideas as possible based on a broad pain point and scale backwards as new things are discovered. \n \nI consider myself more of a methodical creative and feel having a scientific method to design is what (should) differente UX design from‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶normal design. \n\nWhat‚Äôs your thoughts?

Her method is to only comment in figma when something isn‚Äôt working or needs to be changed. She does so in a direct way, usually cold.\n\nShe lets me usually choose what to ask for feedback on, yet the reality is she wants to see literally every decision I make, even often times will critique on padding and margins. She does this for other designers, too. \n\nShe does have a trained design eye, obviously more than me. \n\nAlso, she cannot use figma. Like when it‚Äôs comes to auto layout, she cannot grasp it. Can only mock up very basic concepts. \n\nAs a result, I‚Äôve been feeling like a pixel pushing monkey and I‚Äôm sick of always needing her to okay everything. \n\nIt‚Äôs really sucking the joy out of the job and the grind is wearing on me.

It's a tool that, when properly understood and utilized, can enhance personal relationships, therapeutic practices, and workplace dynamics alike. So for example:\n\nTherapists: Integrating human design into therapeutic practices can offer deeper insights into clients' behaviors, struggles, and strengths. It can serve as a guide to tailor approaches that resonate more deeply with the individual's inherent nature, potentially transforming therapeutic outcomes.\n\nEducators: Understanding the principles of human design can enrich educational methods by acknowledging and catering to the diverse learning styles and interpersonal dynamics of students. It's about moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to education, recognizing the unique contribution of each student\n\nFor errbody: At its core, human design teaches us about the mechanics of being human. Learning about your own design, and those of the people around u, can lead to more harmonious relationships, increased self-awareness, and a deeper appreciation for the diversity of human experience. Hell yes\n\nwe need to disseminate the knowledge of human design far and wide. This isn't about converting skeptics into believers but about providing a new lens through which to view human interaction‚Äîa lens grounded in human design aka the science of differentiation.\n\nWe live in a world craving genuine connection and understanding. Human design offers a path to both, providing a framework for appreciating the complexities and beauty of human interaction. And By educating a broad audience about this framework, we can contribute to a more empathetic, understanding, and interconnected society. Thank you very much.\n\nAnd the application of human design principles in enhancing human interactions is just beginning. It requires educators, therapists, and pioneers to lead the charge, armed with the conviction that understanding our inherent design can lead to a more compassionate world.\n\nWe‚Äôre not just talking about a new approach we‚Äôre talking about empowering individuals across various fields with the knowledge to transform how we connect, communicate, and understand one another on a fundamental level. Through education and open dialogue, the profound insights of human design can enrich our collective experience, making the world a more interconnected and harmonious place.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt believe it then why don‚Äôt you look up your own chart at mybodygraph.com \n\nWondering wtf am I looking at? Go to chat gpt and type in your type, profile, authority, channels and incarnation cross to get started. I‚Äôm telling you. It‚Äôs an enlightening start.	0	0

My hypothesis is that UX plays a critical role in achieving mainstream adoption for innovative products.\n\n**The Challenge: Reaching the Mainstream**\n\nMany startups struggle to move beyond early adopters and reach the mainstream market. This gap, often referred to as ""crossing the chasm,"" requires a shift in focus.  While early adopters prioritize being first, the majority market prioritizes ease of use and clear benefits.\n\n**Early Adopters vs. The Mainstream**\n\n* **Early Adopters:** Driven by the ""reflective"" layer of emotional design (reflective thinking), they prioritize being first to use new products and are willing to overlook usability issues.\n* **Mainstream Market:**  Driven by the ""behavioral"" and ""visceral"" layers (ease of use and intuitive design),  they need clear benefits to justify re-learning existing mental models.\n\n**The Importance of UX**\n\nWhen a startup's product concept is too revolutionary and doesn't align with the target user's mental model, ignoring UX can hinder mainstream adoption.\n\n* **Conceptual Model Mismatch:**  If the product's way of doing things requires significant re-learning compared to existing solutions, even strong benefits might not be enough.\n* **UX as a Bridge:**  Solid UX research and testing can help ensure the conceptual model aligns with the target user's mental model, or at least provides clear guidance to overcome the learning curve.\n\n**Beyond Early Adopters**\n\nWhile marketing, being first-to-market, or lower prices can drive initial adoption, long-term success requires a focus beyond early adopters. We need to consider the entire emotional design spectrum - ensuring the product is not just conceptually sound, but also usable and visually appealing.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy prioritizing UX and bridging the gap between the startup's vision and the user's mental model, startups can increase their chances of crossing the chasm and achieving sustainable mainstream adoption."	1	5

In this feature, users need to successfully onboard three accounts to the app before their own account gets activated. I'm curious about how the backend of this process works and how it communicates and updates the system when an invited account becomes activated. It seems essential to understand these technical aspects before designing the related screens.	6	1

Currently, we are conducting content research for the project and using the heuristic evaluation methodology to analyze the website's content. During my studies in Human-Computer Interaction, we employed heuristics alongside scenarios with a specific user and tasks to evaluate the websites/apps from a user-focused perspective.  Now, in this information architecture course, the context is different. We are using the Abby Covert method but we are not sure if we need to create a task or scenario before doing the evaluation? How should we prepare for the heuristic evaluation for the information architecture on a website? Should we create a scenario then?\n\nAnd now that I'm making questions, what are the best tools to start user research when you don't have a lot of time? Is it use cases and personas enough?\n\nThank you for your time!	4	2

The styling is work in progess, so please ignore the not readable text, buttons and all of that. Besides changing the image name and adding a description, the user can add tags to the image, making it easier to find later. Same for the boxes which are just like folders.

They are keen on embracing Atomic Design as a principle going forward, which I‚Äôm totally on board with. \n\nOne thing I‚Äôm struggling with a bit is that they would like to name our component groups according to the Atomic Design stages, literally calling components things like ‚ÄúAtom / Button‚Äù. In my mind it makes more sense to group components based on their functional purpose, which would (IMO) make it easier to find the component you‚Äôre looking for. \n\nI.e. if I want an accordion, my first thought is not ‚ÄúAn accordion is an organism!‚Äù \n\nAnother issue is that we are doing the best we can with an existing application that didn‚Äôt have a design system or standards. So, they are trying to inventory and categorize all of the existing designs, resulting in numerous components with lots of variants and tons of instance swapping. I think it will become overwhelming soon, and IMO, finding all the ‚Äúatoms‚Äù and ‚Äúmolecules‚Äù in something that already exists is vastly different from creating a new design system that is modular and scalable. \n\nI‚Äôm wanting other designers‚Äô thoughts on whether this is a standard practice and makes sense. 	27	25

Now when it‚Äôs time to do UX and UI and he brings stuff to critique I feel like crying on the corner, or running to the mountains.

It‚Äôs a disaster. \n\nI‚Äôm a Principal moved back to an outcome team, but I still feel it‚Äôs my job to give lots of feedback, but shit, the intern I‚Äôve been mentoring for a year is doing better higher quality work.

December rolls around and we lost some contracts, so the comp adjustment was much lower than expected. Contract for my product gets cut in March (last real revenue generator for us) and the whole design team got laid off.\n\nNow that I'm trying to find my next role, I'm really feeling like that title promotion would have been very helpful...any advice?  \n\n\nEdit to add a little more context: I spent 10 years in another design industry, not specifically digital UX before switching to UX 2 years ago. UI/UX comes very naturally to me, and my former employer recognized that I have much more relevant experience than a 2 year ""boot camper,"" hence the pending promotion. However, on paper, I think I probably look much more inexerienced than I am (however maybe that's me just being overly optimistic and I really am just a 2 year boot camper, I'm sure I'll hear more in the comments) Perhaps this is a whole other topic, but I am feeling that the Senior title would be helpful in convincing other employers that I have the equivalent of more ""senior"" experience....definitely agree with all the comments that titles are fairly meaningless in general in this industry."	36	49

I've prepared a questionnaire and want to get answers from people who practice yoga. I can think of obvious ways to find people from my local city like go to yoga schools, communities, etc. So I think it shouldn't be much of a problem.\n\nBut I would like to reach out to people from other countries as well, so I can have an understanding of how things are outside of my country.\n\nI tried sharing on Reddit, but most communities here don't allow surveys to be posted, probably for very good reason (I wouldn't want to have spams of individual thesis surveys if I was a mod either, I think they don't really add to collective value).\n\nI also found a site call Poll Pool which has a system of coins for filling surveys. It looked too niche for me, and I think the people engaging with that website is not significant either, so it'll not be a good option to find regular people interested in yoga over there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has lead me to think about the point of my survey even more. Throughout my design classes, I've been taught to start with research, so without much thought the first thing I made was a list of relevant questions and designed a form for it. But now that I think about it, I feel like the answers to those questions are not going to define my product, I can't hope that people going to type descriptive answers to tell me the why behind their problems. The answers will just be a validation test for my assumptions and hypothesises about people's yoga experience.\n\nSo should I stop not sleeping thinking about how to do the perfect research, and just get on with it, gather the responses I can, and go ahead with making the product. Then conduct further research as I encounter more problems and questions along the way??\n\nI'm lost here, any help would be appreciated.	2	1

For example yellow buttons with white text, or yellow text buttons, yellow headers. I have various projects, some are multitenancy, meaning we just adapt existing design to a different theme. Some customers and my own company have horrible primary and even secondary colors. I have no say in it, since it's the company's CI done before my time. My favorite is the yellow tone on an off white background or light grey text, which even I am struggling to read sometimes. I have been complaining about it for years, but it's the company's color scheme. What would you do?	9	1

UXDesign	2024-04-02 22:09:07	1	Aleventen	Junior	UX Design		Is this how Design is?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bubi70/is_this_how_design_is/	"I have been, what I now understand a Designer to be for just about my entire life. I have been taking things apart and putting them back together, at 12 I was taking doodles of gadgets, inventions and reverse-engineers of things I saw on TV to my teachers for feedback, I have always been talking to people, even as a child, understanding their problems and going home to dream up solutions. I never really had the wherewithal or ability to **make** any of these things - nevertheless...\n\nAt 30, I decided to make the pivot to product design after a professional lifetime of technical work and engineering. I decided I was tired of being pigeonholed into a corner and told to just ""make this"" or ""we have a problem with x, validate a solution and write up a protocol"" or whatever. I decided I wanted to get back to my creative childhood passion, even if it came with a pay cut; I wanted to work with people and collaborate and move fast and break things and learn and perform direct research about *how* the product I was making was supposed to actually *serve* that user/human.\n\nIt's been a few years and I've noticed some things and I wanted to get a sense if I was just confused by my own confined perspective or if others share the same feelings.\n\n1. I feel very isolated in my work. Whether I am employed as a staff designer, a contractor or working freelance, especially since the prevalence of remote work became so dominant, I feel very alone. I basically sit at home, hopping from zoom to zoom, listening to music and working mostly by myself. There isn't really a ton of collaboration, especially on smaller teams unless it is for critiques or what I have come to call ""spot checks"" where some designer just hops into my Figma to see what I am up to and how things are going - not a ton of brainstorming sessions or collective research review or prototyping and analysis.\n2. There is a massive, rather unspoken, pressure for perfection which is something I surprisingly feel more now than I did in engineering. At least, when looking for a job, there is this weight of needing to already be this perfect designer with this perfect style and perspective. I must say, it is **very** understandable, with all of the money on the line, that this would be the case. I really hope I am not phrasing this wrong, so I will try in another way too. I suppose what I mean to say is that I had expected much more collaborative work where solutions are always rough and operating off of research and data. Where failure during prototyping was expected and that the point was to see prototyping really as an extension of research rather than a Pass/Fail value judgement. The idea of a solution being ""pedestrian"" or ""simplistic"" or what-have-you has been lost on me for a while due to my fast and loose, invention focused, engineering background.\n3. The professional grind can be rough, in a way. It seems that a lot of professional time is going to be spent freelancing, hopping from project to project as companies willing to invest in perennial product R&D efforts seem to be relatively few and far between. Far from finding financial and professional stability, where one can grow with and invest in a particular team and product space/concept. It seems that employment is at the whims of the innovative desires of executive leadership. One can be hired for a year or so until the company decides its product line is fine as-is and initiate product department lay offs. More often, roles come in as short contracts or just freelance work.\n4. *""I wanted to work with people and collaborate and move fast and break things and learn and perform direct research about how the product I was making was supposed to actually serve that user/human.""* It feels as though there is very little of this within the pragmatic reality of the professional world. The reality has been presented as an isolated experience not as dependent upon UXR or data and that project timelines don't really allow for full-scale ""Double Diamond"" brainstorming, collaboration, prototyping, redesigning, etc. It seems more like a Designer will receive an order from on-high and be expected to, more-or-less, design a final solution from that alone - any research done would probably just be from myself and what I can find online either in articles or competitor analysis.\n\nThis is not to trash Design as a profession or a practice. And, again, I am relatively new with only a few years of *proper* experience. So I am curious if everyone thinks these observations are the result of bad personal experience or if these things are something I should come to expect going forward.\n\nAlso, I may update the comments if other questions come to mind. Being in my 30s, I feel I have to make some pretty hard and serious professional decisions and I may not have covered all of my concerns here.\n\nWhat does everyone think?\n\n"	10	11

I don't want to make the same mistake twice, and waste thousands of dollars just to be part of another trend that oversaturates the market.\n\nHow valuable is a MS in HCI vs an online MS in HCI?\n\nAny advice helps!\n\nThanks :)	27	0

What was not advised or mentioned prior to the forced update is that it would automatically change the payment tier of many customers while removing features they had prior to the update and paywalling them behind the more expensive tier.\n\nNote, as of yet no one is grandfathered in. People who had the ability to save pies remotely have had this feature stripped and moved to the Pro plan (which cost more monthly than the Adobe Suite). \n\nLooking for alternative options that would allow me to build and test apps on devices (cell phones, tablets, iPads) that works on and off line.

Common terms?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bu0nke/differentiating_button_types_important/	I'm presently working on cleaning up an application that has what I'd call 'random jelly bean' approach to using buttons. It's a mess. I'm trying to reduce the number and types of buttons and distill them down as best I can. \n\nAt the moment, I've figured out that I probably have two 'buckets' of button types but am struggling to properly define/name them. \n\nBucket 1: Standard? Data interaction? User confirmation? (Basically your regular form buttons:\n\n`Save | Cancel | etc`\n\nBucket 2: Utilities? Functions? (Tools like edit, view, expand, settings)\n\n`New | Edit | Setings | etc.`\n\nBut I also feel I may be overthinking this. How important is it that I differentiate between these visually? Maybe it's not? \n\nMy thinking so far is\n\nBucket 1 = buttons involving choices (do this or that) or buttons that affect data (save, delete). \n\nBucket 2 = buttons I use to access tools\n\nBut I can't seem to find much written about this idea of having 'tiers' of button types so now I'm thinking I might be overthinking all of this. \n\n&#x200B;	3	1

I love it. I think Reddit has been notorious for containing antiquated components, but I do see them slowly evolving their designs throughout the platform and that makes me really happy. \n\nOne specific feature I'm liking on desktop is having the recent posts on the right column. The right or third column is typically used for tertiary actions and information. Being able to utilize that space for posts that I've looked at recently shows me that they are considering my tendency as a user to want to refer back to those posts (even when I didn't comment, save, or upvote it). \n\nInterestingly, I feel like upvotes, saves or comments were used as a means to refer back to the posts. And I also feel like they'd want these to be higher on average - so implementing this must have some repercussions in terms of conflicting metrics. \n\nI think they are making bets, and are starting to think outside of the box and I'm here for it!	12	0

For context the company is around 500-600 employees and I work with a design team with 3 other product designers. \n\nFor about the first 9 months things were going great. I loved my design team (one of which is an amazing designer and taught me so many things). The only problem is that the CEO micro manages everything. And since everyone is scared to upset the CEO, it really destroys any semblance of structure or process. The designers will go through weeks of designing to make sure we create the best, and most modern  solution for the user and even after it is approved by the head of design, developers, and product managers, it's about 50/50 whether the CEO will hate it or not. I've personally worked on projects that took months and was approved by everyone up to him before he goes on a tirade saying it was awful and that if I wanted to keep my job I needed to do better, before he then backseat designs something that looks like early 2000s malware. \n\nAt first this was manageable but recently my best friend at work was fired without warning because he pushed back on an idea from the CEO that would have been an absolutely terrible experience for the user. And now me and the other designer are taking on twice the work and are so demoralized that we feel we can't even give our opinion on ux anymore for fear of our jobs. \n\nI want to look for something else but I'm scared of getting somewhere else just as bad. Is this normal?\n\nEDIT: just to clarify, this is not about designs being scrapped or not liking the boss. The issue I am having is that I feel like I am not allowed to advocate for the user whatsoever and not being trusted to do my job.	52	62

Top-level comments that do not include requests for feedback may be removed. When asking for feedback, please be as detailed as possible by 1) providing context, 2) being specific about what you want feedback on, and 3) stating what kind of feedback you are NOT looking for:\n\n***Example 1***\n\n&gt;**Context:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I‚Äôm 4 years into my career as a UX designer, and I‚Äôm hoping to level up to senior in the next 6 months either through a promotion or by getting a new job.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Looking for feedback on:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Does the research I provide demonstrate enough depth and my design thinking as well as it should?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**NOT looking for feedback on:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Aesthetic choices like colors or font choices.\n\n***Example 2***\n\n&gt;**Context:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I‚Äôve been trying to take more of a leadership role in my projects over the past year, so I‚Äôm hoping that my projects reflect that.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Looking for feedback on:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This case study is about how I worked with a new engineering team to build a CRM from scratch.

(No fooling.)	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bsumsn/sub_feedback_freeforall_quarterly_salary_survey/	**No April Fools**\n\nThanks to all 140k sub members for making this sub an interesting place to see what's going on in UX. Here's an update from the mods, who are actually not [sitting in the filth they've created for themselves](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7179321560535568384/), although if we were we would not want to extend that misery to others! We want you all to like it here, and ask for your help in making that happen.\n\n**Quarterly salary survey**\n\nWe started a salary survey this year, and today marks the second quarter, so we'll have this post stickied all week ‚Äî it's always accessible in the wiki. We redirect all discussion of salary to this sticky. Please contribute your anonymous salary info to help other UX professionals know how to price their labor in an unfeeling capitalist hellscape. We just ask that you post under the appropriate region, and your comment will be deleted if it's in the wrong place.\n\n[Salary Sharing Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/collection/311f36d2-9278-4127-9ecc-b353feed5a22)\n\n**Mod shares in pre-IPO Reddit**\n\nI was given the chance to purchase pre-IPO shares at $34 and I purchased 15 for a total of $510. u/UXette was given the same chance and did not purchase any. As of right now, my investment is worth $739.80. The $239.80 doesn't really cover all of the volunteer hours I spend around here, but I enjoy the mod work. Having a relatively modest stake in RDDT is also kind of amusing for me, but if anyone is worried that being a shareholder will compromise my judgement regarding our shared life in an unfeeling capitalist hellscape, please let me know.\n\n[Stock chart showing Reddit \(RDDT\) trading at $69.00.

To post in the main feed, you should have a few years work experience, be working at least at your second position in the field, and be asking about a problem on the job or with your career.\n\nWe are open to all your feedback about what you'd change. Don't like the flair? Think the rules are confusing? Wish we'd provide more options? Let us know. If you have nice things to say about the sub we would appreciate hearing them, it distracts us from sitting in our own filth fending off rats.\n\n**Unmoderated experiment**\n\nAt the same time, we're going to do an experiment where we stop actively moderating the sub for a week. Asking for your feedback isn't valid if we're removing posts that you never get to see. Mods get analytics data and we remove more than we allow. So for the next week, everybody gets to see the view of the sub that the mods see. (Automod will still be active because I don't want to deal with what might go wrong if we shut it off.)\n\n[Bar chart showing published and removed posts over the past 30 days. 483 posts published; 612 posts removed. Published posts decreased by 120 from the previous 30 days; removed posts increased by 80 from the previous 30 days. On March 25, 2024: 19 posts published, 23 posts removed.

We'll start removing posts again next week after we've had a chance to see the results of this experiment, so please weigh in on what you'd like to see more or less of.\n\n**More! Features!!!**\n\nWe enabled some additional capabilities and welcome your thoughts on their usefulness.\n\n* **Chat**: Reddit has a new chat feature and we have turned on a single general chat channel. If we decide to keep it, chat will need some careful moderation, including a taxonomy of channels and automod controls, so please consider this an experiment.\n* **Polls** : Polls are a post type that we didn't have enabled, now we do. Will the results of your research be valid? Who cares, polls are fun.\n* **Golden Upvote**: I'm honestly kind of embarrassed to share this, but Reddit now allows people to pay $1.99 (or more?) for a shiny upvote. It's awards, but much worse, and available to you now, but only on mobile.\n\n[An array of upvotes with increasing levels of graphic design intensity, priced at $1.99, $3.99, $5.99, $9.99, $19.99, $49.99.](https://preview.redd.it/owyrkd5yrsrc1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=6467c678eac54939841c164df56bf33744a9a77e)	26	14

The people in charge will say that they tried to solve problems for users. Every company will publicly pay lip service to society and promise the public that they‚Äôre doing everything they can to make their products and services better, faster, more effective and efficient, but it‚Äôs all lies. \n\nCorporations and companies lie all the time. Boeing, Comcast, Electronic Arts, Fox and Nestle are just a few. They‚Äôll do everything they can to steal your money and back out on their commitments. They say they want to give their customers the best experience, but they care more about pleasing their own superiors. If you‚Äôre a UX designer that works for a company, think about all the times you‚Äôve been ordered to do exactly as the product owner says. Would they have you replaced if you didn‚Äôt? \n\nAs a UX designer, I am a professional pawn. I‚Äôm the one that gets caught in the crossfire and sacrificed for the greater good of the team. The real power players on the board say they want to hear our strategies, but they couldn‚Äôt care less. They don‚Äôt want someone in their way, telling them they‚Äôre wrong, upsetting their apple cart. They don‚Äôt want to hear honest feedback from users, which may go against their playbook. All they want is for us to shut our mouths and make the product look pretty, like good little robots.\n\nThis is why they don‚Äôt want us. This is why we‚Äôre having trouble finding work. \n\n\n	65	0

I used to read a lot of articles on LinkedIn and Medium, and I felt the tone was very open about new ideas and practices. We even shared a lot of those ideas in the agencies I was at and debated whether we should implement them or not, but there was never a moment where we shouted at others.\n\n **""WE SHOULD DO THIS WAY IF NOT IT'S NOT UX""** \n\n&gt;Now, however, I see a hostile environment with posts on LinkedIn such as:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""You are not getting interviews because you are not doing these 10 things...""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""Do a case study in your portfolio, or it's not UX Design.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""You are not a real UX Designer if you can also make UI Design.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""If we don't measure KPIs, you do not have a seat at the table.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""If you don't use design thinking workshops, you are not a 'real' UX Designer.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""Wireframes are useless; go directly to UI.""\n\nEveryone seems entitled and is gatekeeping information, it's very hostile, especially towards juniors who may think they need to do ""1 million things"" to do UX Design when, in reality, it's much simpler than it seems. The majority of deliverables are still the same as before. \n\nI feel that it's super petty and negative coming from those influencers because they just want to show off their ideas of ""know-it-all,"" ""look at all the processes I had, double diamond, blah blah."" This only influences junior designers and companies who know nothing about UX Design to then sell their courses, teachings, and consulting - yes because the majority don't even have skin in the game.\n\nBut in the end, I also think it influences us indirectly because it will always question us to think ""Are we doing UX the right way?"" after changing to 5 companies I realized it's all the same, some are more mature than others - of course, agencies are different tho because we work between designers.\n\nBut how did such a nice and empathetic environment we had 5 years ago become filled with these people?\n\nIs it just me who feels this way maybe?

I declined in November 2023 as the total compensation was ~15k lower than my current role (I am on London salary) but they‚Äôve called me back March 2024 and asked me to reconsider if they can match my current salary (way above average for the region). This is despite the head of product confirming he‚Äôs shortlisted two candidates for the role yet still asking for me to reconsider (much needed ego boost to stoke the imposter syndrome)\n* 1 day a week onsite (not an issue)\n* no lengthy interviewing process, confirmed by hiring manager (1 stage with HR, 1 stage with hiring manager)\n* company leadership is incredibly archaic and digital maturity is as low as it gets with one head of product and one product manager - developers and designers are agency. (I.e a lot of hand holding coming my way)\n* after a failed multi million digital transformation project, the business went through two series of redundancies and closed down operations on their other ecommerce business late last year\n* way too low in maturity to have scrum, agile or product approaches - often HIPPOs are dictating and expertise can be left unlistened to\n\nThe big question I have for you is which role would you pick and what is your reasoning?\n\nSome reservations and personal thoughts:\n* I‚Äôm worried about US corporate culture will be highly prevalent in role 1 - coming from a relaxed agency culture, I‚Äôm worried this will be unsettling. I‚Äôve worked for enterprise level clients (an American one too) but I‚Äôm hesistant it‚Äôll be different as a perm member of staff\n* I‚Äôve never worked in software before and I‚Äôm not sure if this is a good career decision to make (is there good job security in this economy? Will I be able to find new roles if I wish to move on?) - from a skills perspective, I asked the ux manager if it concerns him that I‚Äôve never worked in software and he said no as long as the ux background is solid. \n* I‚Äôm seeking a career role rather than just a job and I don‚Äôt know which of the two roles can offer that\n* I‚Äôve always shyed away from corporate roles (I can‚Äôt speak corporate) but the market is terrible and maybe I need to suck it up if I like money\n* role 1 confirmed they would support my journey to get accredited from NNG (2 more credits to go!) and the UX manager is certified himself. Role 2 doesn‚Äôt even know what NNG is.	12	3

They also said that they wouldn‚Äôt tell me that if they didn‚Äôt believe I could meet that expectation.\n\nThing is, they also asked whether I was happy in my current position and if I was considering moving since they feel like my motivation is currently low.

Honestly, I've never truly felt deserving of the title of a UX designer. Throughout my career, the companies I've worked for lacked a structured workflow or design process; they only expected UI mockups as deliverables without any user research or interviews. And even to this day, the development and technical teams heavily influence my decisions, sometimes to the detriment of user experience, as management prioritizes time efficiency over user-centric design.\n\nIn all my experiences, I've been the sole designer on the team, lacking any defined process or methodology in my design approach. I made design decisions based on assumptions and internet research, occasionally reflecting on past designs. I never conducted user interviews or based decisions on real user data. My workflow typically involved receiving requirements and diving straight into UI design.\n\nThis has led me to question whether I'm truly a UX designer or just a UI designer or somewhere in between. I feel left behind, undervalued, and unsure of how to progress in my career.\n\nI've never formally studied UX design, and I lack a website portfolio; all my works (UI designs) are stored in a Google Drive folder.\n\nI want to elevate my skills, leverage my past experiences, and transition into a real UX designer role. What steps should I take to gain the necessary knowledge and experiences to own the title of a UX designer and work within a genuine UX process grounded in user research and data?\n\nIs it my responsibility to introduce a UX workflow in the project I'm working on, not having sprints of design ahead of development sprints?\n\nHow can I stop being a ‚Äúhandy designer‚Äù who just works on random design pages (often with technical influences that make for a horrible user experience) focusing solely on producing mockups?\n\nI'd appreciate any advice or insights on how to deal with technical teams that limit design decisions and how to establish myself as a proficient UX designer.\n\nThank you!	24	50

The audience would be a hiring manager/ Senior iD looking at the site after I have applied for a job posting. This requires instant attention because they will move on fast. My portfolio write up is not this so I need a hook to get them there. \n\nApologies in advance if I make mistakes on the specific terminology,  I am an amateur who knows this is not my strength but I am always trying to learn.\n\nCan anyone speak to the implications of designing my website with an initial landing page without multiple screens of info scrolling down?\n\nI want to embed  a 1-2min short title/intro demo reel that I am currently making in After Effects that is multi device responsive. The end leads  to a clear CTA to learn more about my case studies (portfolio). CTA (not sure if it would still be called that)  is also always available in the  header to skip the reel and go directly to the portfolio.  \n\nThe rest of the pages won‚Äôt be single screen- the   portfolio page will be a scroll down with a mix of video text, images and infographics. \n\nBonus question: I heard a lot of Ux/Ui designers hate on side menus but I thought it might be helpful for portfolio sections to navigate descriptions sections of projects.

However, the way they approach this part of the process is different than other portfolio reviews I‚Äôve done and I need help. Below is what I was sent in an email. \n\nPortfolio Presentation Overview:\nWe‚Äôd like you to cover (3) projects (10-15 mins each). Below are the areas we are interested in learning about, please choose (3) of the following topics. Ideally two projects are UI kit presentations of the design system and one project will be an application of a system:\n1. Design system - Accessibility\n2. Design system - Form heavy, high interaction\n3. Mobile (web, app) - responsive\n4. Design system - Tokens\n5. Micro interactions\n6. Design system - Documentation\n\nThe thing is, aside from documentation I don‚Äôt think I have enough work to do an entire presentation on any of the topics. I‚Äôve created component libraries (or as they call them, UI kits) with accessibility in mind and we transitioned from theme variables to tokens and I had to apply those to the library. It just feels like if I were to pick those topics, I would be bs-ing my way through a presentation. \n\nAnyone have tips on how they‚Äôd approach this?	3	6

The aim is to make the software sellable and easy to use, so that more customers can sign up to the product. However in my first month into the job, I have encountered certain issues:\n\n1. The software's interface is too old-school and complex to use at first glance (imagine UI in 2007ish!). This is a legacy software that was ""forcefully"" brought into life after years of hiding it. Which means, a lot of the user flows and interfaces are already outdated compared to today's standards. While I attempted to propose a totally new interface and flows, it was quickly dismissed by the business/project manager and devs, stating that the devs will not have enough time and resources to implement the changes, which brings to the 2nd issue.\n2. The devs are extremely adverse to changes. I am not sure why, but there's only one coordinator and one dev working on programming the product (in legacy C#!!) and according to them, it will take 2 weeks to move two buttons from one side to another and everything is hard-coded, therefore they will not accept any functionality or flow changes. Plus since it is on legacy C#, there is no way to add new functions due to the limitations of the language.\n3. The copywriting for all options are screwed. It might make sense for the programmers and people who are used to the complex system, but if I feel uncomfortable with the wording, I doubt the future customers will be making sense out of it.\n\nIs it normal for enterprise software like POS system to be complicated for usage? How do I convince the devs and managers to switch over to new interfaces? Else do I really have to suck up their complex and conventional designs and design within constraints?\n\nI really feel bad because this product is not on par with mainstream POS system like Lightspeed, Odoo or Square. The current customers are all small enterprises who are all not as tech-literated and think that complex system is the way to go (even if they accept it they still have to undergo hours of tutorials). The complex system has already chased away future customers, but with the current team, I doubt nothing much will change."	21	13

I normally deliver designs for 3 breakpoints: desktop, tablet and phone. \n\nIn my current company, for designing their website, the dev team said they needed the designs in more screen sizes. I was more than happy to deliver. So far I‚Äôve done 6 or 7 screen widths. Everything is in auto layout. It‚Äôs a simple static website. \n\nNow they have come back saying the designs are not responsive and they are having trouble developing it. One of the hero sections had a full width image as a background, and they made me change the design because they said they weren‚Äôt able to scale the image for different screen sizes. \n\nI‚Äôve never faced this issue before. All dev teams before picked up seamlessly from the screen sizes I‚Äôve delivered. I normally do a pretty rigorous design QA, and they have all fared well. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm at fault here.

UXDesign	2024-03-29 17:15:00	1	CurvatureTensor		UX Strategy & Management		Hi UX, how can we devs get y'all involved in open source projects?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bqumfb/hi_ux_how_can_we_devs_get_yall_involved_in_open/	Hi there. I'm a long time tech org professional. I started as a dev, but have been in leadership for most of the past eight years with dev/design/and product reporting to me. One of the things that has been interesting to learn managing the three groups is how different the professional development looks for the three.  \n\n\nIn my experience this comes from the fact that UX and product are forced to compete with each other for development resources. This in turn makes collaboration more difficult, and thus the mentorship from senior UX folks to more junior UX folks more challenging. Add in the pressure cooker of business, and it's no wonder the number one complaint I got from my designers was a lack of professional development.  \n\n\nWhich brings me to my post here about Open Source. There's a huge pool of developers making a whole range of things, and much of it looks like garbage, and will never be used by anyone because we have no idea how to build a good user experience lol. \n\nI'm wondering how we can make it more inviting/appealing. I've searched this sub, and there's a little interest, but the entire industry operates with eng, pm's, and ux, and it feels bad that one whole sector of it just doesn't have much representation from two of the groups. So my question is, is there a way the OS community can make itself more welcoming/appealing to you as designers?\n\nAnyways, I've rambled on long enough. I can't invite y'all to anything per the rules, but if you're interested in finding a community of open sourcers, feel free to dm me.\n\nEdit: Wowsers!! I was not expecting anything close to this level of interest. Clearly this is something we need to do a better job of opening up to the broader digital community. \n\nI believe I‚Äôve DM‚Äôed everyone a link to our discord where we‚Äôre building an OS community. Even if you don‚Äôt end up joining us long term, feel free to DM me questions about OS you might have as I‚Äôd love to see more people involved. \n\nThank you all for your interest! It really made my day. On the discord I‚Äôm planetnineisaspaceship, and feel free to ask me any questions there too. \n\n	240	137

I recently started working as a product designer (fyi there are no senior designers here)‚Äîjust me and another Junior. We are currently working on hiring PMs and so, in a way, the head of\nProduct has been acting as a PM. It‚Äôs my first time working with a list of requirements which me and the head of p put together. I am trying to understand how requirements can be understood as IA. The head told me that the tabs of the excel sheet on the bottom and the features within each tab is exactly where each ‚Äúrequirement‚Äù is supposed to live. Frankly, with the project we are working on‚Äîsome of the features/requirememts in each tab do not belong within some of those tabs as the bigger, whole UX experience‚Äîespecially because we are working with a vendor who has strict UI/structure requirements (which btw we only found out about after we wrote all of the requirements‚Äîbefore writing them out we thought we would be building this project from scratch). When I try to bring this up, the HOP tells me that I need to design things the exact way it‚Äôs written in the requirements‚Ä¶ what is yall experience working with requirements? Are they another form of IA? Advice? 	2	0

UXDesign	2024-03-28 01:53:53		Braga_Gearhead		UX Design		How open are UX'ers to other fields of inspiration?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bpjrb6/how_open_are_uxers_to_other_fields_of_inspiration/	I've been working with UX for the last year or so, but I've been an Industrial Designer for 6 years before that or so, since I've graduated on that field. Recently noticed some diferences between the two of them. \n\nFor instance - one is that, for some projects we did back in design school we had to search for inspiration and references from beyond physical products during the ideation phases, such as architecture, nature, a specific cultural zeitgeist, all kinds of fiction, you name it. This allowed us to conceptualize ideas beyond what was already seen and expected in said industries, and to create new themes while increasing our cultural baggage. For some projects we could also challenge ourselves to get out of our comfort zone and try to design other kinds of products, or even tip our toes in other design disciplines, or even researched fields such as biomimetics. \n\nNow, perhaps I might be completely **biased** due to my ID education, and we would do this things when we could or had to. But I don't tend to see the same enthusiast in UX designers (atleast the ones that I've had the chance to hang out with) for things outside of the digital realm. Perhaps a curiosity for tech gadgets, which per se is not bad at all. I'm sure that for companies such as Apple or BMW the scope for concepts and future vision tend to be more broad, and they even build completely new objects to accomodate new digital interaction features (because they're rich). But it's not the reality for many other companies. Hell, creating new products with a brand new concept is a rare thing even for industrial companies as well, right?\n\nI see that our field is very oriented to metrics, impact indicators, deliverables to provide the best possible user experience to the capabilities of the business and tech available. Great, it should! But I also believe that expanding your curiosity to other fields of design and culture could become a source of inspiration for any kind of designer, and that also allows us to tell new stories and take new insights from the world. For instance, the driver dashboard screen from BMW's latest Mini model that is a huge interactive circle and mimics the classic Mini speedometer, or the Apple Vision that looks like a scuba diver's glasses.\n\nBut how often do you see this big curiosity in most UX'ers? And do you even believe that all of this makes too much of a diference for the range of an UX or PD's career?  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;	18	12

Is this normal?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bohdsa/my_team_lead_said_that_its_unacceptable_for_me_to/	As a designer with 10 years of experience, I have never faced an issue like this before. Whenever I start a project, especially when it comes from a top-down request or feature suggestion, I collaborate with my PM and Dev Lead to establish acceptance criteria. This helps me understand the scope of the project and what we are and are not supposed to do. \n\nFor context, acceptance criteria for me is determining the scope of the project, what we can/can't change on a feature, and what we're hoping the results will be from the feature request/implementation. The rest (design, research, solutions) is up to me. \n\nHowever, my team lead, who is also the dev lead and co-founder, got angry and complained to my boss that he shouldn't have to come up with acceptance criteria for me from a dev perspective. He believes it is my job as the UX designer to come up with it. \n\nThe problem is, whenever I come up with it, he pushes back and says it's unrelated to the scope of the project. \n\nSo, I'm confused about what the responsibilities of a UX designer and PM are. In my experience, the PM has always coordinated feature requests and the design/research has been my responsibility. \n\nHowever, now they expect me to come up with the features that need designing and determine the project's scope. \n\nIs this normal?	43	40

I had decided on an approach (teaser up front, linking to a password-protected page with the details). I wanted to add a web site redesign I did for a popular personal care product since I had done other work on it, such as competitive analysis, content strategy, architecture, etc. that I think are great examples to show. I searched for an image to see if there was anything I could publicly used, and found an image that was perfect. Clicked over to the site to see about the copyrights, lo and behold, it's on a marketing company's site, claiming that THEY did the UX and design on it. The UX is mostly the same that I worked on, they just changed the content in a section in one of the pages. The illustrations the visual designer that I worked with had drawn were replaced. Some other small differences here and there, but they were claiming they did things like ""provided a new approach to their website architecture"" ""restructured the navigation"" and  ""implemented a clear customer journey,"" which is all the work that I did.\n\nI saved some of the background docs I worked on (competitive analysis, ia, and some wires) but I didn't get to export the screens since it was the client's Figma behind their firewall, which I lost access to right after that assignment ended. I've reached out to the visual designer and hopefully he saved at least some of the screens.\n\nHas this happened to anyone? I've heard of individuals ~~stealing work~~, taking the credit for someone else's work, but this is a company in my case. I also gave a heads up to the design company I was working through at the time. Either way, I'm adding this to my portfolio, and now that I see they are showing the work publicly, I am going to show it publicly as well since its been such an issue to be able to have public examples. \n\n\*\* UPDATE\*\*\n\nClarification: I had nothing to do with the company that took credit for my work and the work of the visual designer I partnered with. My concern, besides it being a shitty thing to do, was that I would be perceived as the one that is taking someone else's credit for this work, but that part is now a moot point (see below). I guess now it's just a cautionary tale.  \n  \nI made a decision that there is no need to fret over this. Luckily, going through old Slack messages I found a link to the Figma file and was actually able to still access all of my work and the original visual designs, albeit with view only permissions. Grabbing it all now, going to put it into a case study in a password protected page, show just a teaser on the front end like the others. Only because I don't want the design company I was working with to get any flack because of me. I'm just surprised that a company would engage in this, but whatever. I'm moving on from it since my case study will now have all the documentation showing all the legwork I did to get to the design and theirs does not."	16	4

Happy to delete if it‚Äôs a problem. \n\nI joined a startup as their founding designer a bit over a year ago. Initially it was great for the first three months, I felt valued and listened to. Our first product deadline was absolutely insane though. Two weeks to design and build a full product filled with complexity. After this build they swore this wouldn‚Äôt happen again. This has been every deadline since.\n\nEvery single deadline is not agressive, but impossible. I‚Äôm talking repeatedly giving me FOUR days to design FULL products with all breakpoints. With rollouts back to back so I don‚Äôt even have a moment to breathe. I‚Äôve pushed back so much but to no avail. \n\nInitially I was so excited but the concept of the product and the team that I had enough stamina to keep going but I have been sprinting for over a year now with multiple months continually working 12-16 hour days, pulling more all nighters than I ever have before. I‚Äôve worked in plenty of startups as a lead designer or a sole designer but this is intenable and a new extreme. \n\nThey‚Äôve maintained an external design company for branding (which I welcome as I am not a brand designer) but it has been two years and they have yet to settle on brand guidelines. \n\nI have also been scoping out the product as well. I‚Äôm so exhausted and I feel the physical and frankly emotional and mental toll it‚Äôs taking on me. Having to constantly churn out half baked designs and making critical ux decisions with a brain that feels like it‚Äôs barely functioning at this point‚Äî it‚Äôs killing my confidence as a designer and I‚Äôm feeling so hopeless. Ive had to go back into therapy because of this job. \n\nI have been incredibly vocal and communicative about both how stressful this is to me as a person but beyond that, how awful it is to the product in the long term. I‚Äôve been in the game now for 8 years, and while I have more to learn, as I hope to always have, I feel confident in my abilities as a designer and product thinker‚Äî but I feel continually set up for failure at this point. They told me to trim as much fat as possible and when I tell you the fat HAS been trimmed.  We‚Äôre talking, NOTHING nested, no components made (I‚Äôve implemented a pre-existing library but there are no states and plenty of bespoke components still need to exist given the product), no guidelines or documentation. Everyone has to work off of assumptions. I‚Äôm trying my very best but I have cut so many corners. \n\nBeyond this, I love the team and the product is compelling but for the work I do, at the speed I do it, the company head makes me feel so unvalued and the management skills and prior leadership experience are questionable.\n\nI know that I need to leave but I barely have time to come up for air and I love the rest of the team so much I don‚Äôt want to put them in a very tough position by leaving. But I‚Äôve been setting down boundaries and they have been continuously disrespected. How in the world can I carve out time to recover and update my portfolio and resume? I give plenty of good solid advice to my students and mentees I but I‚Äôm having a hard time listening to myself and could really use some support after trying to advocate for both myself and the product so many times onto deaf ears.	23	22

UXDesign	2024-03-25 21:58:49	1	ShySprout224		UX Strategy & Management		My ego, startup drama, and burnout	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bnqeld/my_ego_startup_drama_and_burnout/	My story might be a common one. You pursue a career as a UX designer with the intention of enhancing user experiences, only to discover that 90% of your time is consumed by seeking buy-in or clarifying the concept of UX itself. To make matters worse, your designs either never see the light of day or you‚Äôre made to create experiences that disregard user needs.\n\nHere‚Äôs my story. I‚Äôm curious to know what others have similarly experienced and how you overcame it.\n-\nThe job market isn‚Äôt the greatest right now, and it isn‚Äôt the friendliest towards junior designers. I‚Äôve been job hunting for almost a year now and had to pick up a full time job working at a restaurant. In order to keep refining my UX skills and add to my portfolio, I picked up a 9 month contract job as a product designer at an early stage startup. \n\nIt‚Äôs been 6 months now, and needless to say, it has been a mess. Their previous designer had quit, leaving me to pick up where she left off as the sole designer of the team. The main problem was that the company couldn‚Äôt find a product-market fit and has pivoted multiple times. \n\nAs a designer, this has been incredibly frustrating. I‚Äôm constantly pressured to produce designs from scratch and rapidly so they can pitch their ideas immediately. Without a defined target market, I‚Äôm tasked with creating new platforms and features to cater to various needs and desires.\n\nRecently, I have been extra vocal advocating for a more user-centered process. I wanted to help bring clarity by using my UX skills to identify a primary persona so we can design and prioritize solutions that meets the needs of the user best. I drafted a timeline and a research plan. The PM and CTO gave me full support, but the CEO did not take my initiative very well. He argued that the core reason the company ideas were a mess was because everyone had different ideas that were not his. He ended up firing both my PM and CTO for having a different vision than him. \n\nWithout anyone in leadership backing me up anymore, it‚Äôs been really stressful.\n\nBecause my manager is no longer a part of the team, I‚Äôve been reporting to the CEO. He micromanages and doesn‚Äôt like it when I challenge any of his ideas. At every team meeting, he would comment on others work saying, ‚Äúgood job, this is amazing because I came up with the idea and you executed exactly what I wanted.‚Äù I can‚Äôt help but feel he is directing those comments at me. It‚Äôs a pretty toxic relationship right now. \n\nIt‚Äôs also frustrating when he insists he knows UX design better than I do. My ego takes a hit every time he dismisses the importance of accessibility or reacts with eye-rolls and scoffs when I remind him that he doesn‚Äôt represent the user persona. \n\nI want to create good UX work because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm passionate about. I‚Äôd ideally like a project for my portfolio to help me find a job in the future too, but I‚Äôm not sure how I can do good work if I am not given any autonomy over my work. \n\nFor now, I‚Äôm tired from standing up for myself and need the money. I made it clear to the CEO that these are his ideas and also his money. If I need to just pixel push, then I can do it. But wow, it does not feel good to graduate with a design degree and be treated like a starving artist.	30	20

Is it as much of a thing as some suspect? Or are some of us reading too much into it and blaming it as the reason we weren‚Äôt hired when it had nothing to do with it.\n\nPersonal experience, I‚Äôll be 51 this year, I remember when I was in my early to mid thirties hiring, and there was definitely a few people getting uncomfortable if an older person was being interviewed ie someone my age now, and the tendency was to go with the person who was a ‚Äòfit‚Äô. Ie someone who would go for beers after work, would play five a side football after work etc. with the team, or someone who didn‚Äôt feel like their parents.\n\nNow that I‚Äôm this vintage I can‚Äôt help but feel something similar was happening when I interviewed with companies.\n\nReason I bring it up is Jane Austin wrote an extensive post on the hiring process being broken on LinkedIn, and the major point that got the most reaction was ageism. \n\n\n	29	29

I‚Äôm currently a junior UX designer at an e-commerce. I joined the company as an intern and was extended to full-time 6 months ago. Since then I‚Äôve been mainly doing usability testing, and user research (lots of competitive analysis). The only design projects I‚Äôve worked on so far are 1. assisting another designer with a big project, and serving as back-up and 2. A small project that took about a month for research and design combined together.\nMy question is how do I ask to be involved with more design projects? Don‚Äôt get me wrong i love doing research but I don‚Äôt want to become a UX Researcher, I enjoy design more and i want to gain more experience. How do I stand out if I‚Äôm not designing much?\n\n	13	21
UXDesign	2024-03-23 22:52:01	1	Chosen258		Senior careers		Is it realistic to be expected to take on a second project randomly yet not compromise the quality of my main project?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bm5f54/is_it_realistic_to_be_expected_to_take_on_a/	Edit: To give some context, the issue is more related to transparency. Project/client 1 reserves and pays for 100% of my time and it‚Äôs used up as well. Now they want me to take on project/client 2 without telling project/client 1 about it, expecting me to make up for it.\n\nI'm a UX Designer at a large organization. Currently, I'm assigned to a single project at 100% capacity.\n\nI was recently promoted to Senior (on paper, at least), and my lead now expects me to be flexible. He says that this is expected from Seniors.\n\nThis means that if a 30-60-100 or so hour small project comes through the door or we hire an intern/junior who needs mentoring, I should be able to take care of these without stakeholders noticing this on my main project.\n\nIs this really expected from a Senior UX Designer? I can take care of these for sure, but I don't see how without taking some form of compromise on my main project, thus stakeholders noticing it.	35	21

We‚Äôre backfilling the position, but leadership wants another junior designer, instead of an experienced designer. \n\nNo shade to junior designers - I was a newbie when I joined too - but our team is now entirely junior designers (considering myself to be included). Our leadership are technically senior designers, but AFAIK the entirety of their UX education and experience has come from working in our org, and kind of transitioning into UX from other fields.\n\nThe strategic reason for only hiring juniors, I‚Äôm told, is that it is more difficult to train senior designers in our unique way of doing things and out of the habits they‚Äôve gotten into at other orgs.\n\nSo now, we‚Äôll be a team of 5 or so designers, but with nearly 0 experience of working or practicing UX anywhere else but college/internships, or at this org.\n\nIt seems a little shortsighted to me, because we‚Äôve been experiencing a lot of growing pains, inefficiencies, and process challenges as a team, and it seems like leadership just doesn‚Äôt want to have to butt heads with someone who has opinions about the way UX and product management should be practiced (this is more or less why some of our experienced designers and others in our product org have been trickling away).\n\nFor others who‚Äôve been a part of building up design teams: does this strategy make sense?

UXDesign	2024-03-23 06:19:07	1	Gnardashians	Experienced	Senior careers		Are you getting interviews? Checklist	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bllgaf/are_you_getting_interviews_checklist/	"First off, I am not a 'thought leader' or design guru or influencer or anything like that. I am a senior product designer who's been at it for 8 years. I wanted to share a comment I made on a thread based on my personal experience and turn it into a post in hopes of helping others who are looking for a job right now in this terrible economy. I've heard so many people saying 'I'm a senior and haven't had an interview in X months'. That should not be the case. If you are senior or even midlevel, you should at least be getting interviews even in this market. Source: I have been getting multiple interviews per week.\n\nIf seniors are struggling to get interviews, something's wrong. Either with your (general 'you') resume, portfolio, or the way you're presenting your experience. Assuming you're not a bootcamper with 14 months under your belt calling yourself 'senior', you should be getting interviews. You should at the very least be moving on to the next round of hoop-jumping bullshit and have the opportunity to complete an unreasonable take home project, complete unethical specwork for free and do the monkey dance for everyone and talk about how much you want to live their company's corporate values in their daily life‚Äîand then get ghosted.\n\nIf you are not at least moving on to the next layer of hell, something is wrong. it might be:\n\n\* Resume. Is it simply formatted for an ATS to read? Did you include all the new buzzwords you asked chatgpt about and embed them? Did you use overzealous and aggressive language like 'spearheaded' and 'innovated' instead of 'led' or 'managed'? And if not by god you'd better start. Also worthwhile is Teal and Earnbetter. Earnbetter drafts custom resume and cover letters for you for each role but \*make sure you proofread the documents\* because I discovered too late that it sent out a cover letter claiming I had a master's degree in graphic design (lol???)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\* Age discrimination. I've read so many comments saying ""I have 15/20/25 etc years of experience and can't get an interview!"" My dude, that might be exactly why you are not getting an interview. Go ahead and shave off anything beyond 10-15 years from your resume and linkedin. They can find out your age on the background check. Similarly, if you are leaving two spaces after a period or using a serif font, stop because that can also age you. Take the year you graduated college off as well if it's over 15 years or so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\* LinkedIn. Make sure you have some sort of photo so you don't look like a creepy lurker. Make sure your keywords are maxed out and you have your buzzword accomplishments listed. Add/Connect with/follow anyone and everyone you can. Any person you add gives you access to their network and if they apply to a job and comment on a post you'll see it and can apply to the same one. It's not facebook. Don't treat it like a place to only add people you know. Be aware of your comment history. Make sure it's professional and something you want prospective employers to see. If it's not, delete your comment history. I saw a post from someone talking about how he had been undiagnosed with bipolar and it turned out he was just in a toxic polyamorous relationship with his two ex boyfriends. Also don't make a post about how you haven't gotten an interview in months. Yes, people like authenticity but only a sanitized version. Otherwise you might be commiserating or entertaining people, but you might be scaring away skittish hiring managers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\* Portfolio. Is your portfolio current? Does it showcase 3-6 of your best case studies? Do the results include metrics? Is the work outdated? No one wants to see projects from 10 years ago even if it was good at the time. Is your thumbnail well designed? Is there too much text? Not enough process? Did you update the design to make it visually appealing for an audience? Don't just put a crappy flow diagram in there. Make it really nice. Update the visuals and it can be the version that didn't quite make the cut for when it got shipped. You can still keep it in the ballpark and make it the version you wished it could be. Get free design feedback from the professional and FREE mentors on ADPList. I had several rounds of critique that immensely improved my portfolio and everyone I spoke with was professional and incredible insightful and helpful. They even gave me feedback for interviewing strategies. You can speak with industry leading professionals who have years of experience, FAANG/MAANG employees, design leaders, creative directors, etc. Whoever you want, the best of the best. Also, hiring managers do not dig your figma portfolio. If you don't want webflow or squarespace, use UXFolio for free and even the paid version is not that much\n\n* Edit to add: Job Gap. If you have a job gap no you don't because you've been freelancing and working on a passion project with a confidential client\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\* IF YOU DO THESE THINGS I promise you will get at least get interviews! ü§ô\n\nFeel free to add anything I may have missed."	119	264

It‚Äôs all just process and product management theatre with no actual eye for solving problems. They don‚Äôt talk to users except as facilitated by UX.

My manager has been a great coach and says what's preventing me from being a true senior are my soft skills (stakeholder management, knowing how to lead, creating impact in the business). \n\nThing is, in my current role, it's quite a high-pressure role. I'm working across 3 squads, delivering solutions at speed according to roadmaps, and I'm expected to handle doing BAU work AND also work on levelling up my skills. I don't have time to work on my own skills during work time. I can choose to do it during work time, but that will impact my work. I can do it outside of work, but I'm so drained by 5:30pm/6pm that I don't have the energy. I just want it to be a job.\n\nI guess I'm frustrated that there seems to be a trend that in order to be a Senior, you have to live and breathe design. I got into design because I like the simple aspect of working on a project and creating solutions that help people. I don't want to be managing stakeholders, or trying to justify my thinking all the time to opinionated people in the business. (I know this is an industry wide problem).   \n\n\nI've actually been looking for other roles, but I'm wondering if I'm actually making the wrong decision which will impact my career, because my current Manager and the culture is actually very healthy and great, and they're all willing to help me become a well-rounded Senior. The roles currently out there I know won't have this level of psychological safety. \n\nI could go into consulting/freelance/agency, which means I stay being that designer where I'm taking briefs and delivering them on a project basis, but there seems to be a limit as to much how I can actually grow there, and I'm worried about my career aspects then if I stagnate at this point. \n\nDo I just leave design altogether???	48	89

I'm currently navigating a bit of a career crossroads and could really use your insights. Here's a bit about my situation:\n\nI'm 27 years old and have been immersed in the UX design world for three years now, specifically in a finance-focused startup. Despite being based in Spain, I've been fortunate to work remotely, enjoying the flexibility and the less stringent KPI-focused environment that my current company offers, albeit with a modest salary.\n\nHowever, not all is smooth sailing. The startup has been around for a while but is now facing significant financial hurdles. The future seems uncertain, and I'm contemplating the stability of my position; it seems I might have only a few months left unless things take a positive turn.\n\nThis uncertainty has pushed me to consider preparing my portfolio and exploring new opportunities. Yet, I'm met with two major roadblocks. Firstly, there's a sense comfort in my current role. The freedom and the relaxed pace are aspects I genuinely value. Secondly, I'm apprehensive about the job market. Despite my three years of experience, I doubt whether I have amassed enough impactful use cases or the depth of experience required to curate a compelling portfolio that could open new doors.\n\nI'm at a junction where I'm struggling to decide whether to cling to the hope that my current company will recover or to proactively step out into the uncertain job market, possibly before it's too late.\n\nI would immensely appreciate any advice, insights, or recommendations you might have. How should one approach this dilemma? How can I bolster my portfolio with perceived limited experience? Any thoughts or personal experiences in similar situations would be incredibly valuable.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and for any guidance you can provide.\n\nWarm regards,	7	4

I'm a UX manager that moved into that role from the IT side. I don't have strong visual design skills (I'm very creative, just not digital designer), but I'm very knowledgeable in UX.  \n\n\nThe UX Designer role has been moving to Product Designer or back to Visual Designer in the current market job descriptions (not the titles per say). (UX Researcher isn't something I'm interested in atm.) Because of this, I'm trying to expand my skills in order to land that next role (and it doesn't need to be a manager, I'm fine with senior or lead honestly).  \n\n\nIf you had to choose one specialization over the other, which would you choose?  \n\n\nProduct or Visual Design?  \n\n\n* Product could require more documentation skills/knowledge, CPO or PM Certs maybe, as well as portfolio that shows the product life cycle?\n* Design could require Adobe certs/knowledge as well as very robust visual portfolio.\n\nI'm leaning towards visual design, but I'm not sure that's a good move career wise. Just looking for some advice and pros/cons.   \n\n\nThanks!	10	0

The market is saturated, automation is on the rise, and financial pressures are dictating design decisions more than ever.\n\nIt's a tough pill to swallow, but the truth often is.\n\nSo, what's the game plan? It's simple: pick the area you want to align with. Align your UX knowledge with marketing, sales, or product. Demonstrate how UX can drive success in those areas.\n\nTo the UX veterans who believe in the sanctity of a standalone UX department: I challenge you to rethink your position. The landscape has changed. The businesses thriving in this late-stage capitalist environment are those that integrate ‚ÄúUX‚Äù into every facet of their operation, not those that isolate it.\n\nLet's not view this as a demotion but as an opportunity. An opportunity to influence from within, to drive change where it matters most, and to prove that UX/Design is not just about making things look pretty but influencing business decision making. \n\nEDIT: Yes, I am quite aware it‚Äôs been like this for quite some time. But how this manifests itself now is in various titles that may not even have ‚ÄúUX‚Äù but are still including UX skills. It‚Äôs important to look here.	41	0

Ever since I was an intern, I was scolded for ""too many graphics"" in engineering reports I'd create.  Over the years, I made internal websites, loads of creative presentations, and even apps for internal use.  Usually all were considered 'nice', and 'allowed' since they related to my primary work, engineering, but they weren't necessarily why I was hired.  I didn't realize until a project where I was assigned as a temporary person to fill a hole that we would not typically have an engineer fill that UX actually seemed like it may be the calling I missed.  I never fully embraced my creativity when I was looking for my path in life.  I thought I needed to go towards what was safe, and technical roles seemed to be that.  I didn't even consider creative work (other than application to circuit design) valid for a long time.  I am draw to UX, and now I'm almost ready to embrace it (and what a great job market to do it in too :/ ).\n\nHowever, there's some other psychology afoot that I want to explore before making a mid-career jump with kids to support.  All of the times I did UX as an engineer, those made me stand out.  Eventually, I applied design flow to things like dashboards and websites, and got good at making data comprehensible.  It gave me a sense that I had value.  I think I used my creative abilities to carve out a feeling of psychological safety for myself, whether actually true or not, amidst a sea of dark waters, where uncertainty about my worth and looming layoffs could threaten to sink my ship.  Having the ability to apply myself to my own creative projects, for whatever reason, gave me a sense of hope, EVEN though it wasn't what I was 'supposed' to be doing.  I can't explain it any better I'm afraid.\n\nIt seems like the UX crowd is generally more accepting than most.  Everyone seems to have recognized a light in themselves that they are excited to share with the world through their role.  I guess my question is: when I jump to UX, how much is the work truly one's own, versus something you **have** to do?  I know this will be company dependent, and I realize as a company, a design project is a work assignment, and not optional.  But I also don't seem to see stories of UX designers who just ""turn the crank"" and don't put anything of themselves into their work.  How much does the environment ever become ""just a job""?  Is there a fair amount of autonomy?  Does the entry level person share the same unique significance as a senior when it comes to owning the work as a part of themselves?  I guess I'm just trying to make sure my head isn't totally in the clouds by getting familiar with the realities of day to day UX, because I'd really like to believe that what I have is valuable and that I can contribute in a meaningful way, and that I'm making the right choice jumping into it, leaving a career behind where I make a fair amount, hoping it doesn't become ""just a job"" and me having lots of regret.\n\nThanks for any advice.\n\n&#x200B;"	61	61

I've noticed a trend where designers include lengthy case studies in their portfolios, even for straightforward projects like ecommerce or generic landing pages. It got me thinking - are these detailed case studies really necessary for such well-understood designs? On one hand, they showcase the designer's thought process and attention to detail. But on the other, if the solutions are widely known, why spend so much time and space on them? Is the extra effort in documenting every step of the process really adding value, or could that time be better spent elsewhere? Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you find long case studies overkill for simple projects, or do you see them as an essential part of a designer's portfolio, regardless of the project's complexity?\n\nLooking forward to your insights!	7	5

PM, BA?	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bii0md/transitioning_from_ux_to_new_role_but_which_one/	Hello fellow Designers!\n\nI have 5 years of experience in the UX field as a Designer and Researcher. For the past 3 years, I have been involved in a project where, instead of building and designing complex applications, we focused on innovation. Our task was to rapidly gather business requirements, build MVPs, and verify hypotheses. I thoroughly enjoyed this approach, as it had a significant impact (not only financially) on the entire company.\n\nHowever, over the past two years, the company has been constantly laying off employees, leaving me with almost nothing to do. This is a clear sign for me that I should seek new opportunities. The question now is, what role should I pursue? I am particularly interested in the strategic aspects - scoping, creating hypotheses, building business models, designing quick MVPs for stakeholders, and verifying them with users.\n\nDo you have any ideas for which role I should apply, and how challenging the transition might be? Alternatively, should I continue searching for a UX role that is more strategy-oriented?	18	11

I've been going through the interview process with this company for about a month now. \n\nAfter the 3rd round (cultural fit) I thought I had it in the bag, only for a 4th round (another cultural fit with more team members) to be added to my calendar last week. \n\nIt went really well, I liked the people, they seemed to like me, and I have no reason to think it didn't go well, however, as the days have ticked by, I've lost all optimism about this particular role, just because of the anxiety of waiting for an answer. I'm assuming the next response I get is either an offer letter or telling me they're not going forward with me. \n\nWhat is everyone's take on this? Tomorrow is a week since my 4th round. Is this a normal time frame? Am I right for feeling less optimistic than I did before the 4th round interview? How many more rounds could there possibly be?\n\nI'm not getting down on myself but I'd be lying if I said I'm not frustrated by how slow this is going and the anticipation is the worst part.\n\nUPDATE: They responded to my follow up email. They are still interested in potentially bringing me on but are still meeting other candidates and are trying to accelerate the process as best they can.\n\nI'm not banking on anything, but glad they at least responded and are keeping me updated.

We are developing a tool to help AI practitioners to test the models they have developed.\n\nTo test the model, users create tests and test suites. A test suite contains tests and test suites. You recognize the recursive nature. The user recognizes that a test suite failed and wants to dig deeper to check which tests within which sub/sub/subtest suites caused the test suite to fail.\n\nMy current solution is very primitive. I simply nest all the available test suites in one another, but I genuinely dislike it. Not only will it fail if the nesting is deep enough, the non-collapsed box takes up far too much space.\n\nI have considered one page per nesting level, but we want the user to monitor where they started. As a solution, I also thought of a breadcrumb to keep track of the nesting level. But that didn't convince me neither. Moreover, I though of a file explorer like structure in a sidebar that keeps track of the tests, but the tests themselves don't contain so much information one could use an entire page to fill it. I would love to use a table to display the tests and test suites. But given the recursive nature and the fact that tests might consist of slightly different attributes that doesn't seem to work.\n\nNeedless to say that I am not a trained designer but a software engineer without much UI/UX experience. I don't use Figma or any design tool. I draw up sketches of the users' flow and the screens and try to translate it to code immediately.\n\nI am very much looking forward to any ideas how to take this further.\n\n\n\nThanks so much!\n\n\n\n[The non-collapsed test suite that takes up far too much space.](https://preview.redd.it/mv25322mi3pc1.png?width=2115&format=png&auto=webp&s=c164d691315bd8ef0960eb9f544404213f76dcd2)\n\n[The nested test suites](https://preview.redd.it/ffvw8vmei3pc1.png?width=2089&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fa5641e4fa01db411b5047431337e5a05c978f0)	6	0

I am someone who considers functionality over aesthetics, and would rate an app 5 on 5 if the service/product as they claim(in terms of quality or convenience), but blinkit experience was different than this opinion.\n\nI would appreciate if everyone can share their opinion on this, how do you think packaging is crucial in UX or is it just a compensation of poor product?\n\nThanks!	2	1

I already contribute directly to code, write my own CSS, and dabble a bit with React (pretty familiar with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc etc.) and basic JavaScript, but still consider myself to be **miles** away from a real engineer (web, mostly). \n\nI've been feeling this growing anxiety that there's no more space in the international market for just ""a designer"". You've got to be a *design engineer,* contributing to the code with lots of code autonomy knowledge under your belt. I'm not sure if I'm freaking out because I'm already working on a niche company where competitors are at the cutting edge (like Vercel, Browser Company, Clerk, etc.),  and they're the ones potentially coining the design engineer career path, with plenty of people becoming *the* reference in the space (thus also adding a lot of bias to my perspective), or if my assessment has some level of general accuracy.\n\nThe thing is, I have *nothing* against becoming a design engineer. In fact, it's precisely what I've always wanted and gets me super excited. The reason for my anxiety is just that I feel like this needs to happen incredibly *fast* now. I guess the pandemic and all of these efficiency-seeking layoffs sort of made the market realize how much a designer that doesn't code is not that efficient.\n\nI thought I had more time to learn coding, and being a designer first and coding second was a differentiator. Now, I feel like not being a fully-fledged front-end dev *first* is a weakness. Everybody knows how to do basic research and design UIs. I guess I'm freaking out because I feel like I need to become an engineer in a quarter of the time, learning everything for yesterday.\n\nDoes this resonate with any of you?

The problem is my education is in Graphic Design and whilst that was the role I was hired for, it has quickly pivoted to UI/UX and at times I fear I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.\n\nInitially I was tasked with sprucing up their socials, and polishing up documents. Just general day to day basic graphic related tasks. Shorty after they decided they needed to completely remake their website to match the quality of the new designs I‚Äôve been making and that of course has been my new task. Using all the new branding that I have created from scratch, I have finished the first iteration of the website.\n\nI know how to use Figma, and the web developer there is absolutely great. He has been teaching me a lot about the workflow between developers and designers. It has been completely invaluable to me. The employees all love the first iteration and I will be now redesigning the 3 more, along with 3 more rebrands. Problem is I absolutely hate the design, I think it‚Äôs complete trash. I feel like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Call it imposter syndrome but I‚Äôve had maybe one semester in UX and I don‚Äôt even think that was enough to cover basics. \n\nI‚Äôve been working my ass off trying to learn more pretty much every hour I have available to me. Are there any free resources available anyone could point me to ?\n\nConsidering it‚Äôs a startup, I‚Äôm very much aware I‚Äôm being taken advantage of, I dont think anyone there understands the role of a graphics designer.

The main problem I personally feel with case studies as a junior designer is that I don't know if my solution really generates an impact on the user or on the business. Yes, I wrote a nice big case study using big words like information architecture, user flow, user personas, blah blah, but I want to see if all this big process and xyz things made an impact on the business or user. And if not, was it worth it? As a designer, I feel like I am not here to sell my process to anyone. I am here to sell my solutions. Following a good process is very important, but why would any user or business care about how the process works? As a designer, it's my job to follow a good process and generate a solution through the process. How can I check if my solutions are really worth it or not?\n\n(correct me if I am wrong) One solution, according to me, to this problem is if I go through the same process multiple times, understanding every aspect of the process. I will know how to make the most out of it, and after a point in time, I will come up with good solutions.	12	5

I love learning about whats happening in the space and understanding the nuances and opportunities that come with new advancements. I have a concern that we are so blinded by AI ""designing for us"" that we could be missing out on a wider opportunity.\n\nIs there anyone talking about using AI to dynamically tailor experiences? I am talking about going even further than tailored content recommendations that are delivered by the likes of Netflix and Amazon. I'm talking about full dynamically rendered experiences that are tailored to the end user.\n\nE.g.  Imagine you are looking to adopt a pet dog and you land on an adoption site. Rather than giving you a complex strew of pages to navigate, the website could instead deliver a 5-minute video with the dogs that are currently available to adopt. Someone else who lands on this site could be given a completely different experience. Different dogs and formatted in a completely different way, possibly in the form of a 500-word blog post with short fact files on each dog.\n\nI have been trying to formulate some concepts on a blog post but interested to hear if anyone has had any thoughts on this. Is this cloud kookoo land or an potential future?"	41	8

However, I'm a bit unsure about the collaboration between UX design and development.\n\nWhat kind of contributions should the development team make in terms of responsive design? And from the UX design perspective, what are the key things we need to know before designing for different breakpoint ranges?\n\nSo far we‚Äôve been designing on 1440px screens and when things stretch or shrink they get ugly. So, I designed a grid library with various breakpoint ranges‚Ä¶ but am stuck now because I‚Äôm not sure what needs to happen next. I know our dev team implements in both REM and px, it‚Äôs not consistent. I think that‚Äôs a problem. \n\nMy elementary understanding is that if we do REM, a ratio would be applied to everything. \nIf we did px, UX would have to establish what size every component is and what typography should do at each breakpoint. \n\nAny advice or insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.	5	3

(Do these have different purposes?)\n\nAt my company, stakeholders have already decided which feature we want to implement. We discussed how adding this new feature (I'll call this ""feature A"") to our user profile page would encourage users to use the profile page more, attract more customers, etc.\n\nI want to conduct some research before actually designing feature A so I can design it better, but I'm not sure how to proceed. For my personal projects, volunteer projects, and school projects, I usually conducted interviews first (asking broad questions) and then decided which feature I wanted to design based on user pain points. And then I tested the wireframes and prototypes with users. But this time, we have already decided on the specific feature we want to implement, and I want to design it effectively. We did receive a few customer support tickets about users asking if we have feature A available on our website. This is one reason we decided to add feature A, but tbh the CEO was the one who strongly desired this feature's implementation (mainly his decision).\n\nI thought conducting user interviews or initial user testing with the user profile page might be beneficial. However, I'm unsure how to proceed due to the lack of guidance üôÅ. I am a junior-level designer, and there's no senior-level designer, UX researcher, or PM on the team. I essentially have to take the lead on this with another junior-level designer.\n\nI think this has become a two-part question, but which approach would be more effective in this situation ‚Äì user interviews, initial user testing w/ current userprofile, or something else entirely? I will definitely test my design later, but my question is Where should I start before actually designing the feature? What kind of questions I should ask, should I ask broad questions?

Essentially designers don't really trust PMs to make the right decisions and complain that none of the decision making is based on actual KPIs. I agree with the criticism, I think the product rigor isn't the best, but also, our product is playing catchup to our competitors so I also see why there is a large focus on implementation.\n\nThat being said, there was a debate around who ""owned"" user problems, ***i.e: Who was the person to decide on what problems users actually have and should be tackled first?***\n\nWhile I think a designer should be involved in the discussions here and should be arrived at as a team with research and data but ultimately it is the product team that needs to make that decision. \n\nI've been approaching this by trying to be the person that bridges the gap between the two teams but feel uncomfortable saying that I disagree with the wider design org as a whole. I wanted to see what others felt about this, should design or product be the ones that define the user problems we try to solve for?\n\nAlso any tips in working in an environment where product and design dislike each other? Fwiw I've never had a problem with any PM or designer and usually both parts of the org get along really well in my experience so this is definitely new to me\n\nThanks!\n\n&#x200B;"	16	6

Technical stuff about **design system** and software framework. Let me know if I'm off topic, but I'm sure people with experience will be able to join the discussion. See, I work at mid-size company (B2B) that the maturity level of UX/UI is emergent, but not structured. \n\nOur components/products is aim for the end-user, but we are selling it to others business that put the components into their final product. We sell a touch-screen and also a mobile app to control their product. \n\nWe are currently having architecture change in software and it is the moment that I can say what we need as User interface requirements. Dev team plan to use Flutter for the touch-screen (embedded) and for the mobile app Ionic framework. **What are your experience with having an unified design system but with different framework?** \n\nWe are looking into using **M3** for the touch screen and Android mobile app, but also planning to use **Apple HIG** for the IOS app. Why is that? Because the value is not in our product, it is essentially in the product that the B2C sells. We want the user to be as close as possible to what they actually use right now (Android & iOS) and to decrease the learning curve of a new interface for the end-user.\n\nOne constraint that we add on top of that is that the business that we sell to want to have  customisation of the UI to differentiate each other. Now, keeping control on all of those UI components will become a big problem with what I'm seeing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Have you guys have any experience with a Multi-Brand Design system or a type of business like us?**\n* **Any thoughts on using material design and Apple HMI at the same time within your own design system ?**\n* **Does the framework choice will affect what design system that we can use?**\n* **Where I can find those kind of expertise? Not for myself but for the company**\n\nI'm the new UX/UI guy(1 year in the company), but have a certain limitation also on what I know about managing different framework with a design system. Also, you can understand there is not a ""Design team"", so kind of a lone wolf here. No design system used in the past, no process at all, the interface were before made by the dev team.\n\nFeel free to comments, open to discussion, positive and negative!"	9	2

Even when he is happy with the work he is non-verbal about it and responds with a ‚Äúok‚Äù. \n\nHe puts up a stern front, which I understand might have stemmed from insecurities of folks taking advantage of him but design requires two-way communication and always end up with him shutting me up to give his inputs. Doesn‚Äôt even consider my suggestions or ideas.\n\nThe hyper scrutiny is giving me anxiety on what he has to say when designing rather than what the user is going to experience. A lot of the design revolves around his input and basically I have become his personal pixel pusher. Would appreciate any advice on how to deal will such a boss. \n\n	80	41

This being the sentiment that we prioritize ""Good Enough"", and worry about ""Perfect"" later. The issue I am facing stems from this team culture where ""Good Enough"" is often destructive or detrimental to design scoping and handoff.\n\nSometimes, the ""Good enough"" scoping done by the PM misses many facilitating interactions or new architectures required to support the requirements. To combat poor scoping, we have begun doing Problem Discovery sessions to ensure we clearly understand the problem space and what ""Good Enough"" is.\n\nOther times, the shortened timeline caused by the ""Good Enough"" scoping leads to sub-par handoffs to engineering where only the Happy Workflow Paths are provided, and we are missing many clumsy paths.

Have 4.5 years of overall experience and 3.5 years in User Experience Design. Ive got a background in physical product design & I landed in UX due to non availability of 3D projects in he consultancy I work for \n\nMy leaning in UX since 3.5 years has been hands-on.\nI‚Äôve worked for a client for almost 3.5 years as a user experience designer. I used to work in silo 95% of the time and hence didn‚Äôt know the right UX methodology to use during the UX research process, didn‚Äôt know the rights questions that I need to ask to both the stakeholders and users as I didn‚Äôt educate myself through any online courses regarding the same. Before I graduated, I was told be a few friends that ‚ÄòUX is doable and it‚Äôs very easy up learn. If you can pursue physical product design, you can easily do UX.\n\nFast forward 4 years, I‚Äôm compiling all the work I‚Äôve done for the client and I‚Äôve realised a lot of loopholes and lack of depth both in the design process and in the designs. Neither I asked the right questions during the User interview nor my design fully solves the user‚Äôs problems completely.

UXDesign	2024-03-11 22:16:05		TallComputerDude	Experienced	Answers from seniors only		"Problematic Patterns I've Seen in ""UX"""	https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1bcg6fp/problematic_patterns_ive_seen_in_ux/	I was *pulled* into UX because I built web sites and recruiters found them. I did not intentionally enter UX. I did not have a design portfolio. I remember a decade ago thinking that UI was neat, but it seemed like an unreasonable dream to pursue. I met many people who did bootcamps and never got jobs in UX. It generally didn't seem worth the trouble or disappointment, so I didn't pursue it. I built web sites primarily because I enjoyed making them and I wanted to share ideas and knowledge.\n\nI've worked at several companies in different industries and across a variety of projects at each of those companies. I've noticed some patterns:\n\n* Companies are usually not *truly innovative* because they want to compete with an existing product. Building a new category is too risky.\n* Design orgs usually don't do anything beyond competitive research. They look at competing products that are presumed successful and borrow ideas.\n* Designers feel pressured to make changes to designs while on call with PMs. I think Figma is partially to blame for this. When a designer can make changes quickly, I believe the PM starts to think design is *easy* and they could just do it themselves. InVision was a helpful as an isolation layer, but it's nearly history.\n* Developers create an initial design themselves because they want to get the functionality worked out. I suspect they do this because the designers take too long to deliver and the developers would rather build something than sit around doing nothing while they wait, especially if they already have access to some form of the business requirements.\n* Design leadership doesn't know the current state of an existing app or site they have been asked to improve. Designers claim to value the UX, but generally aren't willing to use the product. That means they don't understand how it already functions and feels. Designers don't want to take the time to test the existing flows. This is mind-boggling to me.\n\nI'm not here to beat up on designers, but I think I understand why many designers feel devalued lately. Some of it seems related to the state of the industry and some of it appears self-inflicted.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts. Am I dead wrong? Are you seeing these issues, too? If so, how have you worked to overcome them within your own organization?	6	14

All of the courses I have taken in the UX space have involved a course with coursework/exam at the end which is time consuming if we are providing training and practice internally. \n\n**Why:** At my company I am considering creating our own UX design training program, this would involve learning and experience that is relevant to our company and the types of projects that new team members will actually be working on. I felt it would be more valuable than providing a generic course. However, I also felt it would be useful for team members to come out of it with a qualification for external credibility (and also for them to have on their CV if they decide to move to a new role/company). \n\nProbably worth noting, the internal practice projects could not be used as coursework in an external course due to security issues.	3	0

I'm not sure what to expect though. I'm pretty nervous as I was never in the final stage :P\n\nSo far I've done 5 interview sessions - a case study presentation, and interviews with design lead, product manager, head of product and HR. The company has 30-50 employees if this is any relevant.\n\nAs it's with a founder, I imagine he wants to check who I am in general, work ethics and character and such... and interest/knowledge in the industry. hm! Anyone had a bit of similar experience before? Any tips would be immensely helpful. Thanks a lot!!\n\nUPDATE:   \nThank you SO MUCH for the amazing comments, in return I'd like to share how it was.

They became my direct manager.\n\nIn the beginning I thought that it was just in some projects that were older but seriously after 6 months, I have seen that even in new projects they do the same. Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all they don't use a design system.They basically call something a design system which is basically a page full of components very badly made.  All the elements are placed randomly. They never use autolayout or any other properties. When I try to take an element they have created it is always ungrouped and placed just like individual elements in the screen. It has driven me mad! I always try to have my ui screens super clean and every element to be adaptable and be reused in smaller scales etc. They do not understand why I create auto layouts etc to create more complictaed elements.\n\nOn top of that, they ruin my screens. I try to do very clean screens and then they don't even copy them. Because they do not understand how the layout work, they simply delete the layouts and all adjustable settings and fuck up the screen completely!\n\nThey think that they are top notch designer! I kid you not!  Like they say my designs are close to perfect! For my work they always will find comments that make no sense and it is clear that they just need to say something.  \nLike seriously it is like having a child drawing on Paint with them.... I will give you a very simple example. (Btw we use Figma). To create a button they don't do it with auto layout and margins etc. They use a rectangle and then they put a text into it. If they want to add an outline to a list for example, guess what... they add lines between and in the sides of the rectangle...!!\n\nEdit: Besides no figma knowledge there are several other issues. We never do testing, research or problem solving. When I ask how we know that an x option is better or easier for user than y, they just simply say that because they know what users like, they will like it. So basically they call UX what they like. If I dare to question anything, I'll receive a rolled up eye. In addition, when it comes to management they sabotage my work, they never listen to what I say, they roll their eyes when I ask something or try to do like a research, they present my work as their own and emotionally harass me occasionally.\n\nIs this normal? I am not a very experienced designer myself. I have like a 2.5 to 3  years experience so I just need to know from your experiences. Have you seen something like that?	45	7

But I've been searching around and haven't found an industry standard to differentiate between these two:\n\n1) Lottie animations: Usually made with After Effects, by a Motion Designer who animates vector graphics via keyframe interpolations (or frame by frame if needed). And then implemented via a JSON file exported from After Effects.\n\n2) UI animations: Usually coded by an Engineer. Think about a UI card that transitions its content into a full screen page. This are native animations that modify the UI on the screen, and not a file that you ""play and loop"", like with Lottie.\n\nIf you're really into Motion Design, this may seem like an obvious and non-polemic topic. However, at the moment I'm looking at ways to communicate efficiently this difference across many different teams (each with people from different backgrounds).\n\nThe challenge is that, I find very common when we talk about (for example) the need to polish the animation transition between two screens, and folks would go ""ah ok, can we use Lottie for this?"". But this is not how things work.  \n\nCurrently I'm thinking about summarizing it in this way:\n\nLottie is for ""animations"" that you can play and loop through. They do support interactions, but they're limited to whatever is built into the animation made by a Motion Designer. ""UI animations"" are made with native code, and they are used to switch between screens or component UI states.\n\nAny advice on how you would tackle this instead is appreciated. TIA!"	3	3

It's extremely taxing to have to sit on Zoom for this long, especially when I only have 30 min in between these meetings to do work. I usually have 1 day a week where I can actually sit and focus uninterrupted (achieving this by blocking off my calendar and rejecting any invites that day) but I'm falling behind as my to-do list grows with each meeting with little time to actually follow my process and execute. \n\nI've raised this with our Principal Designer and VP of Product and they essentially agree it's a problem but have made zero effort to minimize the heavy meeting culture here. Similar to other startups, there are big underlying design problems that need deep work to solve but I always feel restricted to band-aid fixes and crappy MVP add-on features due to the rushed deadlines and lack of time. \n\nIs this expected? Previously, I was at a pre-seed startup where I would have at least a couple days to get into the flow, but I have not had a single week like this in the past year I've worked at the current gig.	33	21
